##Introduction
The purpose of this report is to document the use of ecosystem indicators within the Mid-Atlantic Council’s Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) initial risk assessment.

<!--A **Risk Element** is an aspect that may threaten achieving the biological, economic, or social objectives that the Council desires from a fishery. By that definition, some risk elements or risk rankings may change as conditions change or new information becomes available. Thus, the EAFM Risk Assessment will be a dynamic and evolving process that will be revisited and updated in future years.

The Council selected a range of risk elements to be evaluated at either the managed species level, the species and sector level, or the ecosystem level. An overview of the risk elements with definitions and associated indicators as adopted by the MAFMC is presented in the table below. 

In the following sections, we describe each risk element in more detail along with proposed definitions of low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk. Indicators are then shown for each risk element and a preliminary risk categorization based on the indicator is presented. For trend-based risk definitions, a Mann-Kendall test for monotonic trends is used to test significance (p<0.05) of both long term and recent trends. Autocorrelation in the time series was addressed by prewhitening the data as suggested by [@yue_influence_2002]. -->

At the end of the document, we summarize risk ranking results across elements in three tables.

*This risk assessment is currently in draft form, pending Council review.*

# Ecological Elements

##Assessment Performance
This element is applied at the species level. The elements below describe risks according to our best understanding of stock status, but assessment methods and data quality shape our understanding. This risk element addresses risk to achieving OY due to scientific uncertainty based on analytical limitations. <!--The MAFMC risk policy accounts for scientific uncertainty in assessments, with methods for determining scientific uncertainty currently being refined by the Scientific and Statistical Committee. Ranking for this risk element will be adjusted if necessary to ensure consistency with SSC methods in the future.--> 

```{r riskass, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | Assessment model(s) passed peer review, high data quality |
| Low-Moderate | Assessment passed peer review but some key data and/or reference points may be lacking |
| Moderate-High | *This category not used* |
| High | Assessment failed peer review or no assessment, data-limited tools applied |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--Stocks with low risk due to assessment performance include ocean quahog, surf clam, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, butterfish, golden tilefish, and bluefish. Squids and dogfish are assessed with index-based assessment methods which rank low-moderate risk due to incomplete survey coverage in some years, and reference points for squids are lacking. The monkfish 2016 operational assessment was unable to model growth or population status due to innacurate ageing methods, so both northern and southern stocks rank high risk for this element. At present, blueline tilefish ranks high risk for assessment type because it is assessed with the data limited methods (DLM) toolbox. *Atlantic mackerel had been assessed with the DLM toolbox and is ranked highest risk, but an age-structured benchmark assessment was peer-reviewed in November 2017 which may change this ranking.*-->

##F status and B status
These elements are applied at the species level. Fishing mortality (F) rates and biomass (B) levels relative to established reference points from assessments indicate the level of risk to achieving OY. <!--Risk level definitions for F and B are below.-->

```{r riskF, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | F < Fmsy |
| Low-Moderate | Unknown, but weight of evidence indicates low overfishing risk |
| Moderate-High | Unknown status |
| High | F > Fmsy |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

```{r riskB, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | B > Bmsy |
| Low-Moderate | Bmsy > B > 0.5 Bmsy, or unknown, but weight of evidence indicates low risk |
| Moderate-High | Unknown status |
| High | B < 0.5 Bmsy |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--Current assessment results for all MAFMC managed stocks are summarized below. Based on these results, F and B status are both in the low risk category for surfclams, ocean quahogs, scup, black sea bass, and butterfish. Bluefish, golden tilefish, and spiny dogfish F status is in the low risk category, and B risk is in the low-moderate risk category. Summer flounder F status is in the high risk category and B status is in the low-moderate risk category. F and B status for northern and southern goosefish stocks were formerly in the low risk categories, but a recent assessment update was unable to determine status, so we provisionally rank them low-moderate risk (unknown but weight of evidence supports lower risk). Longfin squid B is above the established B threshold, and both squid stocks have unknown F status, but F is difficult to estimate because it is very low relative to natural mortality, so they are also ranked low-moderate risk. Blueline tilefish are high risk for F status and have unknown B status and little auxiliary information in the Mid-Atlantic region, and so rank moderate-high risk for B status. Finally, Atlantic mackerel has moderate-high risk for both F and B status due both to failed assessment/unknown status and indications from recent analyses. *Atlantic mackerel status will be updated after benchmark assessment results are finalized in early 2018.*-->

##Food Web (MAFMC Predators)
This element is applied at the species level. This element ranks the risks of not achieving OY due to predator interactions between MAFMC managed species. To rank these risks, the "importance" of each species as predator must be assessed. There are not clear standardized thresholds to define this. <!--Diet information can be used to develop thresholds: an important predator of MAFMC managed species can be defined as having more than a threshold level of MAFMC managed species in the diet by weight. "Dependent" predators warranting a high risk ranking would have a majority (>50%) of diet from an individual MAFMC managed species. -->

The EOP Committee agreed that high dependence on a single prey represented high risk to a predator, but could not come to agreement on thresholds for intermediate risk levels, so this risk ranking uses only low and high levels.

<!--This information is gathered from the NEFSC food habits database and other sources [@smith_trophic_2010; @johnson_growth_2008].  Surfclams and ocean quahogs are not predators of other MAFMC managed species, so they rank low risk for this element. Similarly, scup, black sea bass, and golden and blueline tilefish eat primarily benthic invertebrates. Summer flounder, spiny dogfish, bluefish, and monkfish are predators of MAFMC managed species, but do not meet the threshold of >50% of diet. Summer flounder prey on other MAFMC managed species, including longfin and other squid, Atlantic mackerel, scup, and butterfish (not resolved in food web; combined diet >30%). Dogfish have ~20% of total diet from squids and mackerel, bluefish have ~25% of diet from butterfish, squids, bluefish, mackerel, and scup, and monkfish have ~20% of diet from squids, mackerel, summer flounder, scup, and monkfish. Therefore, these three predators rank low risk for food web interactions with other MAFMC managed species.--> 

##Food Web (MAFMC Prey)
This element is applied at the species level. This element ranks the risks of not achieving OY due to prey interactions between MAFMC managed species. To rank these risks, the "importance" of each species as prey must be assessed. There are not clear standardized thresholds to define this. <!--Diet information and a food web model can be used to develop thresholds. An important prey of MAFMC managed species can be defined as individually comprising above a certain threshold of the predator's diet by weight. "Vulnerable" prey warranting a high risk ranking would comprise a majority (>50%) of diet or have a majority of mortality caused by an individual MAFMC managed species. -->

The EOP Committee agreed that a high proportion in diet represented high risk as a prey (and also to the predator), but could not come to agreement on thresholds for intermediate risk levels, so this risk ranking uses only low and high levels.

<!--This information is gathered from the NEFSC food habits database and other sources [@smith_trophic_2010; @johnson_growth_2008].  Surfclams and ocean quahogs are not prey of other MAFMC managed species, so they rank low risk for this element. Similarly, spiny dogfish, bluefish, monkfish, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, and golden and blueline tilefish do not show up individually as >10% of prey by weight in any MAFMC managed species diets, so they rank low risk. While some MAFMC managed species are prey of other managed species, none meet the defined risk threshold, so all are ranked low risk. Atlantic mackerel is a prey of spiny dogfish (~10% of diet with high interannual variability). Butterfish is a prey of bluefish, but is below the threshold (~12% of diet), and the reference point applied to butterfish considers it's role as a forage fish in general. Cephalopods as a group are prey of summer flounder (~33% of diet), with approximately half of this attributed to "Loligo species" in the diet data, very little to Illex species, and the rest as squid unidentified. Similarly, Cephalopods as a group are important prey of shortfin squid (>30% of diet), but how much of this is longfin squid is unknown, and some is cannibalism. Unmanaged forage (e.g. anchovies, sandlance, >50% of inshore diet) are important prey of bluefish, but MAFMC measures restict fishery development on these species so they rank low-moderate risk under this element. -->

##Food Web (Protected Species Prey)
This element is applied at the species level. This element ranks the risks of not achieving protected species objectives due to species interactions with MAFMC managed species. As above, a food web model and updated marine mammal diet information can be used to establish thresholds of "importance" for predators and prey. <!--There are no MAFMC managed species that are important predators of protected species, so here we rank only risks where MAFMC managed species represent prey of protected species. An important prey of protected species is defined here as individually comprising >30% of the predator's diet by weight. "Dependent" predators and prey warranting a high risk ranking would have a majority (>50%) of diet or mortality caused by an individual protected species.-->

|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | Few interactions with any protected species |

"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--Protected species include marine mammals (under the Marine Mammal Protection Act), Endangered and Threatened species (under the Endangered Species Act), and migratory birds (under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act). In the Northeast US, endangered/threatened species include Atlantic salmon, Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, all sea turtle species, and 5 baleen whales. MAFMC managed species are not important predators of protected species [@smith_trophic_2010], even though monkfish occasionally ingest seabirds [@perry_predation_2013]. Atlantic salmon, both species of sturgeon, and sea turtles are not major predators of MAFMC managed species, as reviewed in the MAFMC Forage Fish white paper [@savoy_prey_2007; @johnson_food_1997; @burke_diet_1993; @burke_diet_1994; @mcclellan_complexity_2007; @seney_historical_2007; @shoop_seasonal_1992]. Information sources for marine mammal diets in the Northeast US [@smith_consumption_2015], and seabird diets [@powers_pelagic_1983; @powers_energy_1987; @powers_seabirds_1987; @schneider_state_1996; @barrett_diet_2007; @bowser_puffins_2013] were reviewed. 

Diet information for protected species tends to be more uncertain than for fished species, so we consider diet at the family level for these rankings because diet compositions are not reported to the species level. Longfin squids are estimated to comprise >30% of diet for one protectes species, pilot whale, in the Northeast US [@smith_consumption_2015; @gannon_stomach_1997], therefore we rank this species low-moderate risk for this element. Shortfin squid were identified as important prey for two pelagic seabirds in the Northeast US [@powers_energy_1987], and therefore ranked low-moderate risk. Unmanaged forage fish such as sand lance and saury were identified as important prey for >3 seabird species in the Northeast US [@powers_energy_1987], as well as grey seals [@smith_consumption_2015]. MAFMC has enacted measures to restrict fishing on these species, such that they rank low-moderate risk for this element. Other MAFMC managed species do not meet the threshold of important prey of protected species based on available information, so they rank low risk for this element.-->

##Ecosystem Productivity
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element ranks the risk of not achieving OY due to changes in ecosystem productivity at the base of the food web. Four indicators are used together to assess risk of changing ecosystem productivity. We examine trends in total primary production, zooplankton abundance for a key Mid-Atlantic species, and two aggregate fish productivity measures: condition factor (weight divided by length of individual fish) and a survey based "recruitment" (small fish to large fish) index. Because many MAFMC managed species rely on benthic crustaceans as forage, a benthic production indicator is also desirable, *but not yet available.*

|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trends in ecosystem productivity |
| Low-Moderate | Trend in ecosystem productivity (1-2 measures, increase or decrease) |

For primary production and fish productivity, the spatial scale of analysis is the Mid-Atlantic Ecosystem Production Unit, as indicated in Figure \ref{EPUmap}. 

```{r EPUmap, fig.cap="Northeast US Ecosystem Production units. \\label{EPUmap}", echo = F, out.width='0.9\\linewidth'}
image_read(file.path(image.dir,"NEshelfEcoRegionsALL.png")) %>%

###Primary production  
Primary production has fluctuated recently with current conditions near average. 

```{r PP, fig.cap="Primary production \\label{pp}", echo = F, out.width='0.9\\linewidth', fig.height=2}

opar <- par(mar = c(4, 6, 2, 6))
soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'MAB PPD', x.label = 'Year', 
         y.label = expression('Production, gC m'^-2 * ' d'^1), 
         rel.y.num = 0.8, rel.y.text = 1)

```

<!--The observed stability in system productivity is in contrast to an apparent shift in the timing of the bloom cycle in the Mid-Atlantic. Comparing remote sensing information from the 1970-80s to recent information suggest that winter productivity was higher in the MAB and that the spring bloom we see today was not as prominent. This change in phytoplankton seasonal biomass may be related to the changes seen in the zooplankton community (see below) suggesting a grazing effect; but, whatever the mechanism associated with these changes, shifts in timing of low trophic level production can affect resource fish species and their early life history stages that feed on zooplankton.-->

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'PPbloomtiming.png'))

```

----

###Zooplankton  
<!--Zooplankton provide a critical link between phytoplankton at the base of the food web, and higher trophic organisms such as fish, mammals, and birds. Changes in the species compostion and biomass of the zooplankton community have a great potential to affect recruitment success and fisheries productivity, and climate change may be the most important pathway for these changes to manifest. Therefore these indices are relevant to both productivity and trophic structure objectives.-->  

Zooplankton surveys have been conducted since the 1970s and have been most consistently executed in the spring and fall seasons coinciding with the NEFSC bottom trawl survey. The time series of zooplankton biovolume suggest that overall zooplankton production has not changed over time. However, the dominant species of zooplankton in the MAB, *Centropages typicus* shows a seasonal shift in abundance, suggesting a change in timing of zooplankton reproductive cycles, which may be impacting fish species such as mackerel.

```{r zoops, fig.cap="A: Centropages typicus spring, B: Centropages typicus fall \\label{Ctyp}", echo = F, out.width='0.9\\linewidth', fig.height=3}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(4, 6, 2, 6))
soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'Centropages typicus spring', stacked = 'A', tol = 0.03,
         rel.y.num = 0.9, scale.axis = 10^3)
soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'Centropages typicus fall', stacked = 'B', tol = 0.03, 
         rel.y.num = 0.9, scale.axis = 10^3)

soe.stacked.axis('Year', expression('thousands per 100 m' ^ 3), rel.y.text = 1.1,
                 y.line = 3)

```

----

###Fish condition
Fish condition is measured as the weight per length--a measure of "fatness". This information is from NEFSC bottom trawl surveys and shows a change in condition across all species at around 2000. Around 2010-2013 many species started to have better condition, while black sea bass remain thinner for their length on average.  
```{r fishcond, fig.cap="Fish Condition (weight/length) \\label{cond}", echo = F, out.width='0.7\\linewidth'}
#I will get the actual code here eventually but just don't have time right now
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'MAFMC_Fish_Condition.jpg'))

```

----

###Fish productivity
The number of small fish relative to the biomass of larger fish of the same species from the NEFSC survey is a simple measure of productivity, intended to complement model-based stock assessment estimates of recruitment for commercial species. <!--There is a general decrease in this indicator when aggregated across managed and unmanaged species in the Mid-Atlantic.--> The plot includes black sea bass, butterfish, clearnose skate, fourspot flounder, little skate, scup, spiny dogfish, summer flounder, thorny skate, windowpane, winter flounder, and winter skate.

```{r fishprod, fig.cap="Fish productivity: Anomalies of recruit abundance per spawner biomass for species in the MAB. Annual anomalies shown are the average of spring and fall anomalies. \\label{fishprodsurvey}", echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width='0.7\\linewidth', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'FishProdMAB.pdf'))
#knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'fishprodlegend.pdf'))

```

<!--To summarize, primary production shows no trend (although the seasonal timing of primary production may be changing). Similarly, there are no trends in overall zooplankton abundance, but a dominant Mid-Atlantic species shows different trends by season, possibly also indicating a shift in timing. Fish condition showed a drop across all species in the early 2000s, but most species appear to have recovered. There is a decreasing trend in aggregate numbers of small fish per large fish. This one clear trend, along with changes in timing at lower trophic levels, suggest a low-moderate risk of changing ecosystem productivity in the Mid-Atlantic region.-->

##Population diversity
This element is applied at the species level. Changes (particularly reduction) in diversity at the species/stock level (size, sex, reproductive). *Needs data workup by species, may not all be done by Oct BUT PRIORITIZE SUMMER FLOUNDER age/size diversity*

```{r riskpopdiv, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

Picture of indicator, reference, or words describing rankings.

##Ecological diversity
This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and therefore poses the same risk to each species. The Council identified changes (particularly reduction) in species diversity as a risk element. Diversity in species composition mainly addresses risks related to maintaining ecosystem structure and stability; maintaining diversity (here estimated as the mean number of species found in a random sample of 100 fish at a station for the Mid-Atlantic portion of NEFSC surveys) can provide the capacity to adapt to change at the ecosystem level and for dependent fishing communities. 

```{r riskecodiv, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Moderate-High | Significant recent increasing trend in diversity measure |
| High | Significant recent downward trend in diversity measure |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

Diversity shows a significant increase for one season in the Mid-Atlantic, suggesting that survey timing may be interacting with changes in the seasonal movement of fish (see above) as well as a potential change in species availability due to distribution shifts (see below). However, additional analysis is required to ensure that the transition between survey vessels did not affect this metric. Therefore, while the criteria above would indicate a moderate-high risk of changing species diversity in the region, we rank this low-moderate risk until further analysis of the ship effect is complete.

```{r, fig.cap="A-Fall, B-Spring \\label{sppdiv}", echo = F, fig.height=3.5}

##Climate
This element is applied at the species level. Risks to species productivity (and therefore to achieving OY) due to projected climate change in the Northeast US were evaluated in a comprehensive assessment [@hare_vulnerability_2016]. This assessment evaluated exposure of each species to multiple climate threats, including ocean and air temperature, ocean acidification, ocean salinity, ocean currents, precipitation, and sea level rise. The assessment also evaluated the sensitivity (*not extinction risk*) of each species based on habitat and prey specificity, sensitivity to temperature and ocean acidification, multiple life history factors, and number of non-climate stressors. <!--This assessment is intended to be conducted iteratively, so these results can be updated in the future. -->

```{r riskclim, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |

<!--Mid-Atlantic species were all either highly or very highly exposed to climate risk in this region, and ranged from low to very high sensitivity to expected climate change in the Northeast US. The combination of exposure and sensitivity results in the overall vulnerability ranking. We applied those climate vulnerability rankings directly here (Fig. \ref{NEVAvul}). -->

```

<!--While this risk assessment focuses on overall vulnerability to impacts of climate, not all impacts will be negative. Some MAFMC managed species may benefit from projected future climate conditions, including black sea bass, bluefish, butterfish, longfin squid, and shortfin squid [@hare_vulnerability_2016].--> 

##Distribution Shifts
This element is applied at the species level. Species distribution shifts can increase risks of ineffective spatial catch allocation; if catch distribution is greatly mismatched with species distribution OY may not be achieved. Risks of species distribution shifts due to projected climate change in the Northeast US were assessed in a comprehensive assessment [@hare_vulnerability_2016]. <!--We applied those distribution shift risk rankings directly here. In addition, changes in species distribution are monitored using fisheries independent bottom trawl surveys. Two distribution shift indicators are derived from these surveys: kernel density plots of recent distribution compared with 1970s distribution, and time series of the along shelf position of the center of distribution.-->

###Changes in Along Shelf Position
<!--Species distribution on the NE Shelf can be characterized by the position in the ecosystem along an axis oriented from the southwest to the northeast, referred to as the along shelf distance, and by depth. Along shelf distances range from 0 to 1360, which relates to positions along the axis from the origin in the southwest to the northeast in kilometer units. The mean along shelf distance for several MAFMC species by year is shown below; most are consistent with the predictions of NEVA and show a northeastward change in distribution aside from squids.  Mean depth has not changed significantly for these species. Information for more species is available at http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/ecosys/current-conditions/species-dist.html.-->

##Estuarine and Coastal Habitat
This element is applied at the species level. Risk of not achieving OY due to threats to estuarine and nearshore coastal habitat/nursery grounds was determined by first evaluating the estuarine dependence of species, and then by enumerating threats to the estuarine habitat required by these species. Here, we include estuarine and nearshore coastal habitat in the term "estuarine" below. <!--Water and habitat quality assessments produced for Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Long Island Sound and other coastal estuaries can be considered in the future.-->

This report lists water, sediment, benthic, and coastal habitat quality as well as fish contamination. Northeast US coastal waters in the Mid-Atlantic region rated fair to poor for water quality, fair for sediment quality, poor for benthic quality, good to fair for coastal habitat, and fair to poor for fish contamination. These ratings were based on nearshore and estuarine summer sampling 2003-2006. The overall coastal condition was rated fair for the entire region, but this includes offshore conditions which we address in the next element. Therefore, estuarine and nearshore coastal habitat dependent species (summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, and bluefish, [@able_re-examination_2005]) were ranked high risk based on overall poor estuarine condition for this element, and all others were ranked low risk due to lower dependence on this habitat type.--> 

##Offshore Habitat
This element is applied at the species level. The risk of achieving OY due to changes in offshore habitat quality and quantity can be assessed using trends derived from experimental species-specific habitat modeling. <!--*In addition, the number of threats from other human uses can be enumerated; at present this is addressed under "Other Ocean Uses" in the Management section below.*-->

*This experimental habitat index is still being studied and improved, so habitat risk rankings based on this are considered preliminary by the EOP and not included in summary tables.* 

<!--Habitat models using both static and dynamics variables have been developed for many of the resource species on the Northeast Shelf. These models estimate spring and fall habitat for the time series 1992 to 2016 reflecting the use of the ecosystem based on the NEFSC bottom trawl survey. The variables evaluated for use in these models included station salinity, station temperature, benthic complexity, satellite derived chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature, the gradient magnitude (front structure) of the satellite data, and zooplankton bio-volume and taxa abundance with station depth included in all models. The random forest approach differentiates variables with strong predictive power and was used to reduce the variable set to 11 variables for each species. The models were used to estimate fall habitat scores over the entire shelf over the time series.-->

<!--Spring and fall habitat trends for Northeast Shelf species over the time period 1992 to 2016 were evaluated using the number square km in a single habitat interval from habitat modeling.  Fall indices for MAFMC species are below, with spring on the following page. *mapping linear model slope estimates for grid locations constrained to the segment of the shelf used by each species. These segments were estimated as a 99% kernel density shapes based on occurrence of each species during the study period.* -->

<!--Overall, black sea bass, summer flounder, and scup have long term increasing trends in fall offshore habitat, and dogfish, butterfish, Atlantic mackerel and longfin squid have short term increasing trends. Goosefish has no significant trend in fall offshore habitat. Therefore, these species rank low risk for this element. However, shortfin squid has a long term and a short term decreasing trend in offshore habitat. Therefore, shortfin squid ranks high risk for this element. 

Ocean quahogs, surfclams, tilefish, and bluefish are not adequately sampled by the bottom trawl survey and were not included in this analysis, similar to unmanaged forage and deepsea corals. Sessile species in particular may be highly vulnerable to habitat changes, so assessments of their habitat are particularly important to develop.-->

#Economic Elements

##Commercial Revenue
This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and addresses the risk of not maximizing fishery value. Revenue serves as a proxy for commercial profits, which is the component of a fishery's value that this element is ultimately attempting to assess risk towards.

```

<!--This is aggregate commercial revenue for MAFMC managed species. There is a long term significant decrease in revenue, indicating moderate-high risk to commercial fishery profit. This trend is consistent with the trend first shown in the EAFM Interactions white paper and published in @gaichas_framework_2016 (Figs 2-3).-->

```

##Marine Recreational Angler Days/Trips
This element is applied at both the fleet level and at the ecosystem level where it would apply equally to all recreationally fished species. Angler days and trips are proxies for the welfare (value) generated from recreational fishing. Risk of not maximizing fishery value is evaluated using the number of marine recreational fishing angler-days and number of marine recreational trips, in aggregate.

```{r riskrecval, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trends in angler days/trips |
| Low-Moderate | Increasing or high variability in angler days/trips |
| Moderate-High | Significant long term decreases in angler days/trips |
| High | Significant recent decreases in angler days/trips |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--Providing recreational opportunities is a stated goal of optimal fishery management as part of the definition of "benefits to the nation" under MSA. Recreational fishing is important in the Mid-Atlantic region with many coastal communities having high recreational dependence. Although there is an overall trend of increasing recreational fishery participation  in terms of number of anglers, the most recent 10 years has shown a striking decline in both recreation indices. -->

----

```{r RecParticipation, fig.cap="A: number of anglers, B: number of trips \\label{recreation}", echo = F, fig.height=3.5, out.width='0.9\\linewidth', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(4, 6, 2, 6))

soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'Mid-Atlantic angler trips', x.end = 2016,
         scale.axis = 10^6, rel.y.num = 0.8, stacked = 'B')

soe.stacked.axis('Year', expression('Recreational participation, 10'^6*'n'),
                 rel.y.text = .8)

```

<!--These significant recent decreases in numbers of anglers and numbers of trips alone suggest high risk to recreational value generated from the species with substantial recreational fisheries (summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, bluefish). This is a national trend likely due to shifting demographics and general economic dynamics, among other issues.-->

##Commercial Fishery Resilience (Revenue Diversity)
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element addresses the risk of reduced commercial fishery business resilience by evaluating species diversity of revenue at the permit level. 

```{r riskfrel1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

<!--This diversity index is the average effective Shannon index for species revenue at the permit level, for all permits landing any amount of MAFMC FMP species within a year (including both Monkfish and Spiny Dogfish). Although the exact value of the effective Shannon index is relatively uninformative, the major change in diversity seems to have occurred in the late 1990’s, with much of the recent index relatively stable. -->

#Social-Cultural Elements

##Fleet Diversity
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element ranks the risk to maintaining equity in access to fishery resources. Two indicators of commercial fleet diversity, including the number of distinct fleets and diversity of revenue across fleets are used in combination to evaluate current fleet resilience throughout the Mid-Atlantic region. 

<!--Maintaining diversity can provide the capacity to adapt to change at the ecosystem level for dependent fishing communities, and can address objectives related to stability. Below are diversity estimates for fleets landing MAFMC-managed species. This measure identifies the diversity in revenue generated by different fleet segments. A fleet is defined here as the combination of gear code (Scallop Dredge, Other Dredge, Gillnet, Hand Gear, Longline, Bottom Trawl, Midwater Trawl, Pot, Purse Seine, or Clam Dredge) and vessel length category (Less than 30 ft, 30 to 50 ft, 50 to 75 feet, 75 ft and above). -->

At the request of the EOP and advisors, the diversity metrics were also calculated giving less weight to the scallop and clam fleets. However, the overall trends are very similar.

<!--There is a long term decrease in the fleet count metric. Therefore this element ranks moderate-high risk. The number of fleets in the Mid-Atlantic seems to be negatively correlated to the revenue diversity metric in the most recent five years, which indicates that the latter results are being dominated by changes in the distribution of revenue across fleets, as opposed to the number of active fleets.-->

##Community Vulnerability
The NOAA Fisheries Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs; @jepson_development_2013) are statistical measures of the vulnerability of communities to events such as regulatory changes to fisheries, wind farms, and other ocean-based businesses, as well as to natural hazards, disasters, and climate change. The CSVIs currently serve as indicators of social vulnerability, gentrification pressure vulnerability, commercial and recreational fishing dependence (with dependence being a function of both reliance and engagement), sea level rise risk, species vulnerability to climate change, and catch composition diversity. We use a combination of these five indicators for the most fishery dependent communities to evaluate overall social risk levels.

```{r risksoc, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | Few (<10%) vulnerable fishery dependent communities |
| Low-Moderate | 10-25% of fishery dependent communities with >3 high vulnerability ratings |

| High | Majority (>50%) of fishery dependent communities with >3 high vulnerability ratings |

<!--Below is a brief description for each category based on the NOAA social indicator study [@jepson_development_2013; @colburn_indicators_2016]:

* **Fishing dependence** indices portray the importance or level of dependence of commercial or recreational fishing to coastal communities. 
*	**Social vulnerability** indices represent social factors that can shape either an individual or community’s ability to adapt to change. These factors exist within all communities regardless of the importance of fishing. 
*	**Gentrification pressure** indices characterize those factors that, over time may indicate a threat to commercial or recreational working waterfront, including infrastructure. 

Communities are ranked as high, medium high, moderate, or low relative to the respective indicator (Table \ref{reliance}). Community dependence on commercial and recreational fishing is mixed, with notably more communities in the Mid-Atlantic dependent on recreational fishing. While communities with high to medium high risk for social vulnerability are broadly distributed in suburban and rural areas of the Mid-Atlantic region, communities with high to medium high gentrification pressure are concentrated in beachfront communities near urban areas in New York and New Jersey.

```

The social and economic impacts of climate change have been modeled through application of social indicators of fishing dependent communities [@jepson_development_2013]. Assessment of a range of social indicators has been applied in the Mid-Atlantic Region to predict vulnerability of communities to regulatory changes and disasters.  More recently this methodology has been extended to include specific indicators of vulnerability to climate change and linked to species vulnerability assessments [@colburn_indicators_2016; @hare_vulnerability_2016]. The tools developed through this approach are vital to an evaluation of the risks of climate change facing coastal communities dependent on fishing. Below is a description of the CSVIs related to climate change.

*	**Sea Level Rise Index** is a measure of the overall risk of inundation from sea level rise based on community area lost from one to six foot level projections over the next ~90 years. A high rank indicates a community more vulnerable to sea level rise.
* **Species Vulnerability** is measured by the proportion of community fish landings that attributed to species vulnerable to climate change. 
* **Catch Composition Diversity** is the relative abundance of species landed in a community. It is measured by Simpson’s Reciprocal Index, and a higher index value indicates greater diversity. Communities with a diverse array of species landed may be less vulnerable to climate change. 

Sea level rise is predicted to have variable impacts on coastal communities. The Mid-Atlantic region has a 3-4 times higher than global average sea level rise rate (Sallenger et al. 2012). Mid-Atlantic communities clustered around the Chesapeake Bay area and the New Jersey shore had especially high vulnerability to sea level rise (Fig. \ref{commrisk}). These vulnerabilities include infrastructure (docks, marinas, bait shops, gear storage) and access to shore-based facilities due realignment of coastal communities.

Mid-Atlantic fishing communities with total landings value of $100,000 or more were mapped for their dependence on species vulnerable to climate change and catch composition diversity (Simpson Reciprocal Index). A number of communities in southern New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia are highly dependent on species such as clams that are highly vulnerable to climate change while displaying low catch composition diversity. Communities with this situation are considered more vulnerable to climate change in general.-->

<!--While the maps provides an overview of the social and climate indicator results for the Mid-Atlantic coastal communities, Table \ref{community} identifies Mid-Atlantic communities that are most highly dependent on both commercial and recreational fishing. The varying vulnerability level to social factors, gentrification pressure, and climate change in these communities provide a more comprehensive profile and should be taken into account in the decision making process for fishery management. 

As a preliminary risk assessment, rankings from Table \ref{community} of MedHigh or High were tallied for social vulnerability and gentrification pressure, along with rankings of High risk from sea level rise, High/Very High species vulnerability, and rankings of Low catch composition diversity. Four of these communities (20%) have three or more of these high risk rankings, so we rank overall social-cultural risk as low-moderate for these Mid-Atlantic communities.-->

<!--#Food Production Elements-->

##Commercial Seafood Provision
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element describes the risk of not optimizing domestic seafood production from MAFMC managed species. Commercial seafood landings (as opposed to total landings which include bait and industrial uses) were used to assess seafood provision.

#Management Elements

##Fishing Mortality Control
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the level of management control in terms of catch estimation (measurement) and monitoring to prevent overfishing. Adequate management control indicates a low risk of overfishing, while poor management control indicates a higher risk of overfishing and hence not achieving OY.  Actual catch is compared with the specified ABC over the most recent five years of fishery history.

```{r riskctl, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No history of overages |
| Low-Moderate | Small overages, but infrequent |
| Moderate-High | Routine overages, but small to moderate |
| High | Routine significant overages |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--The ability to control total annual catch is necessary to prevent overfishing (i.e., defined to occur when total catch exceeds the overfishing level defined in the FMP), which is a fundamental requirement of MSA. Chronic or persistent overfishing can lead to stock depletion and ultimately to a stock being declared as overfished (thus requiring a stock rebuilding plan).  The ability to constrain catch is a function of the efficacy of the catch monitoring program for each species which relies on both proactive (in -season closure) and reactive (pay backs for overages in subsequent years) accountability measures which were implemented post-MSA Reauthorization. Under certain circumstances, specification of management measures which are too strict could lead to “underfishing” (not achieving the desired quota) and hence not achieving OY. This element will be evaluated by fishery sector (commercial and recreational). For the commercial fishery, NMFS dealer data in conjunction with estimates of discards are used to compare target to actual annual catch. Small overages are defined as <5%, moderate as 5-10%, and significant overages as >10%.  For the recreational sector, MRIP estimates of recreational catch are used to compare target to actual annual catch estimates. -->

##Technical Interactions
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the risk of not achieving OY due to interactions with non-MAFMC managed species, including protected species. Here the risk is caused by negative consequences from fishing activity regulated under MAFMC FMPs which interacts with species managed by other agencies, including bycatch of protected species. <!--For example, windowpane flounder accountability measures (AMs) implemented by the New England Council have the potential to negatively impact a number MAFMC managed fisheries if they are triggered. Similarly, interactions with marine mammals protected under the MMPA could result in greater restrictions in MAFMC managed fisheries increasing the risk that OY would not be achieved in those fisheries. For example, the measures necessary for recovery of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale population have the potential to seriously impact numerous fisheries in the NE US.  -->

```{r riskmint, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No interactions with non-MAFMC managed species |
| Low-Moderate | Interactions with non-MAFMC managed species but infrequent, Category II fishery under MMPA; or AMs not likely triggered |
| Moderate-High | AMs in non-MAFMC managed species may be triggered; or Category I fishery under MMPA (but takes less than PBR) |
| High | AMs in non-MAFMC managed species triggered; or Category I fishery under MMPA and takes above PBR   |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--Evaluation of this risk element requires quantification of the likelihood that AMs under other non-MAFMC FMPs would be triggered (thus impacting fishing activities for MAFMC managed species). In addition, NMFS manages marine mammal interactions with commercial fishing activity through take reductions plans. In cases where an MAMFC fishery interacts with marine mammals, conservation measures implemented through a take reduction plan could negatively impact that fishery.--> 

##Other Ocean Uses
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the risk of fishery displacement or damage of a fishery resource and/or habitat that supports it as a result of non-fishing activities in the ocean.  It also includes evaluation of risk to MAFMC fisheries from area based measures outside of the control of the Council including area closures implemented by other Councils to protect sensitive habitats, spawning areas, etc. and/or through marine monument or other types of area based management designations.       

```{r riskoou, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No overlap; no impact on habitat |
| Low-Moderate | Low-moderate overlap; minor habitat impacts but transient |
| Moderate-High | Moderate-high overlap; minor habitat impacts but persistent |
| High | High overlap; other uses could seriously disrupt fishery prosecution; major permanent habitat impacts |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--Non-fishing ocean activities (e.g., energy development/sand mining/other industrial, etc.) and/or designation of areas where fishing is prohibited (i.e., marine monument designations or establishment of habitat protected areas by other Councils) could potentially impact MAFMC fisheries because they overlap with historical fishing grounds (physical displacement) and/or through negative impacts on important habitats.  This element can be evaluated through GIS analyses which quantify the degree of overlap and/or expert opinion relative impacts on habitat quality and function. -->

##Regulatory Complexity and Stability
This element is applied at the species and sector level. Constituents have frequently raised concerns about the complexity of fishery regulations and the need to simplify them to improve their efficacy. Complex regulations may lead to non-compliance and/or impact other fisheries.   

```{r riskcomplex, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | Simple/few regulations; rarely if ever change |
| Low-Moderate | Low-moderate complexity; occasional changes |
| Moderate-High | Moderate-high complexity; occasional changes |

<!--This element could be evaluated by quantifying the number of regulations and/or the frequency of regulatory changes (based on evaluation of the Code of federal regulations). In terms of recreational fisheries, the magnitude and frequency of change of management measures (size and bag limits, seasons, etc.) could also be evaluated/quantified. -->

##Discards
This element is applied at the species and sector level. Stakeholders have identified the reduction of discards as a high priority in the Council management program, especially those caused by regulations since they represent biological and economic waste.  Discards of either the target or non-target species in the fishery would be taken into consideration.

|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No significant discards |

<!--NMFS provides estimates of discards by species based on at-sea observations collected in the Northeast Fisheries Observer Program for stock assessment purposes and quota monitoring. In addition, the MRIP provides estimate of discards by species for the recreational fisheries. Discards will be evaluated for each species and fishery with focus on identification of discards caused by regulations for each fishery sector (commercial and recreational).-->  

##Allocation
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the risk of not achieving OY due to spatial mismatch of stocks and management allocations or because of sub-optimal allocation by sector and/or area.  Indicators for difficulty of allocation include a combination of distribution shifts (see above) and the number of interests (sectors, states, etc.) requiring allocation. 

```{r riskalloc, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No recent or ongoing Council discussion about allocation |
| Low-Moderate | *This category not used* |
| Moderate-High | *This category not used* |
| High | Recent or ongoing Council discussion about allocation |
"

<!--Each species and sector will be evaluated relative to risk based on whether or not there is ongoing or recent (last three years) discussion by the Council concerning allocation. -->

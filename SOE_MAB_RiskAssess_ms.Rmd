abstract: Fishery managers worldwide are evaluating methods for incorporating climate, habitat, ecological, social, and economic factors into current operations in order to implement Ecosystem Approaches to Fishery Management (EAFM). While this can seem overwhelming, it is possible to take practical steps towards EAFM implementation that make use of existing information and provide managers with valuable strategic advice. Here, we describe the process used by the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop an ecosystem-level risk assessment, the initial step proposed in their recently adopted EAFM guidance document. The Council first defined five types of risk elements (ecological, economic, social, food production, management) and identified which management objectives aligned with each element. Based on an existing ecosystem status report for the region and other existing sources (including expert opinion), potential ecological, social, economic, and management indicators were identified for each risk element. Finally, low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk criteria were defined for each indicator, and the indicator data were used to score each risk element using the criteria. The risk assessment highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting Council management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors. Tabular color coded summaries of risk assessment results will be used by the Council to prioritize further EAFM analyses as well as research plans over the coming five years. As ecosystem reporting and operational EAFM continue to evolve in future years, the Council foresees integrating these efforts so that ecosystem indicators are refined to meet the needs of fishery managers in identifying and managing risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives. Overall, ecosystem indicator-based risk assessment is a method that can be adapted to a wide range of resource management systems and available information, and therefore represent a promising way forward in the implementation of EAFM.

#Introduction
For more than a decade, an Ecosystem Approach to Fishery Management (EAFM) has been outlined as desirable policy worldwide to support ecological sustainability and human well-being [@garcia_ecosystem_2005; @sherman_global_2005]. While tactical applications of ecosystem approaches to date are few [@skern-mauritzen_ecosystem_2016], perceived barriers to adopting ecosystem approaches are diminishing [@patrick_myths_2015], and there are practical steps in progress towards EAFM implementation in many regions worldwide [e.g., @ramirez-monsalve_ecosystem_2016; @heenan_climate-informed_2015]. Here, we describe the process used by the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop an ecosystem-level risk assessment.  This represents the initial step in their recently adopted EAFM guidance document, described below, and is intended to provide managers with valuable strategic advice. 

<!--This process developed within a particular governance structure, which we briefly describe.--> The Council is one of eight regional fishery management councils in the United States, and is responsible for conservation and management of fishery resources within U.S. federal  watersin the mid-Atlantic region. The Council is a co-management body with stakeholders integrated into decision processes indirectly through representation by  federal and state fisheries management agencies, and private-sector stakeholders (commercial and recreational fisheries and conservation organizations) and directly through participation on advisory committees and during public comment periods at Council meetings. Council meetings are held every other  month throughout each year. In the Mid-Atlantic, the Council  further incorporated stakeholder feedback on its management through a “visioning” process (2011-2013) which shaped the Council’s strategic planning (http://www.mafmc.org/strategic-plan/). The visioning process identified implementation of EAFM as a high priority across all stakeholder groups. The Council therefore had a series of workshops and developed several white papers between 2014 and 2016 regarding forage fish, climate, habitat, and species interactions (see http://www.mafmc.org/eafm/ for details). At the same time, a national policy on ecosystem based fishery management was developed and released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA Fisheries; https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/ecosystem-based-fisheries-management-policy), establishing ecosystem approaches to fishery management as a national priority.

The Council approved an EAFM Guidance Document in 2017 which outlined a path forward to more fully incorporate ecosystem considerations into marine fisheries management (http://www.mafmc.org/s/EAFM_Guidance-Doc_2017-02-07.pdf). The Council’s stated goal for EAFM is "to manage for ecologically sustainable utilization of living marine resources while maintaining ecosystem productivity, structure, and function." Ecologically sustainable utilization is further defined as "utilization that accommodates the needs of present and future generations, while maintaining the integrity, health, and diversity of the marine ecosystem." Of particular interest to the Council was the development of tools to incorporate the effects of species, fleet, habitat and climate interactions into its management and science programs. To accomplish this, the Council agreed to adopt a structured framework to first prioritize ecosystem interactions, second to specify key questions regarding high priority interactions and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them [@gaichas_framework_2016]. Because there are so many possible ecosystem interactions to consider, a risk assessment was adopted as the first step to identify a subset of high priority interactions [@holsman_ecosystem-based_2017].

This paper describes the process, methods, and ecosystem indicators used to develop the Mid-Atlantic Council’s initial EAFM risk assessment. This risk assessment will help the Council decide where to focus limited resources to address ecosystem considerations by first clarifying priorities. Overall, the purpose of the EAFM risk assessment is to provide the Council with a proactive strategic planning tool for the sustainable management of marine resources under its jurisdiction, while taking interactions within the ecosystem into account. We provide this example to illustrate that ecosystem-level risk assessment is a transparent and accessible tool that can be adapted to a wide range of resource management systems and available information, and is therefore a promising way forward in the implementation of EAFM.  

#Methods
A series of publicly-accessible meetings were held in 2016-2017 to develop the risk assessment, which used data from existing ecosystem reporting efforts, information from previously published reports, and expert knowledge. The general approach was for Council staff and analysts to develop and refine prototypes after discussion with Council members, advisors, and stakeholders, which a Council committee (a subset of the Council appointed to make initial recommendations on particular topics) and then full Council would then adjust and refine. This iterative approach allowed the risk assessment to develop fairly quickly to meet management needs and timeframes. Specific methods used at each stage are detailed below.

A risk assessment prototype was developed as an example during Council review of potential approaches for integrating climate, habitat, social, and economic interatcions into fishery managment (see Figure 10 in @gaichas_framework_2016). This example was reviewed (along with the full proposed EAFM policy guidance) during a meeting with the Council's Ecosystem and Ocean Planning Committee (EOP) in July 2016. While it was emphasized that the example risk table was based on analyst expert knowledge and was for illustration only, it facilitated discussion of which risks ("columms" in the table) were relevant and which managed resources ("rows" in the table) the assessment should address. The outcome of the initial July 2016 meeting was that the example table contained many ecological elements of value, but was missing economic and social elements of risk that were of interest the Council. As a result, all further work on the risk assessment was conducted jointly by analysts with specific expertise in economics and ecology. Further, it the committee was concerned that social and economic risks would vary by fishery sector (recreational or commercial). This outlined the potential scope of analysis and data required.

The risk assessment methods developed primarily between August and December of 2017, in order to have a product for use in research planning for 2018 and beyond. The initial scoping step was to determine which risks were of concern to the full Council to map out the "columns" for analysis. At the August 2017 Council Meeting, the Council developed a list of areas of concern/risks which included those in the prototype table from @gaichas_framework_2016, and expanded to include many economic, social, and management-oriented risks (http://www.mafmc.org/s/EAFM-Risk-Elements-post-August-Council-meeting.pdf). 

In September 2017, the EOP and Advisors met to further refinement the Council's list, as well as to determine level of application for the risk assessment (species, species/sector, ecosystem). This was initially a wide ranging discussion, as it became apparent that EOP members, advisors, and analysts were unclear on how to assess all of the items on the Council's list within a consistent analytical framework. This EAFM risk assessment evaluated a wide range of potential risks to different components of the management system, including managed species, stakeholders, and fishing communities. Development and use of consistent terminology was critical to conducting the assessment within the Council process. It was necessary to define what was being measured, why it was being measured, how it was being measured, and how the measurement could be used to evaluate risk. After this meeting analysts and Council staff worketed together to more clearly define each aspect of the risk assessment. 

*What are we measuring?* A **Risk Element** is an aspect that may threaten achieving the biological, economic, or social objectives that the Council desires from a fishery. By that definition, some risk elements may change as conditions change or new information becomes available. Therefore, the Council explicitly planned for this EAFM risk assessment to be a dynamic and evolving process that will be revisited and updated in future years. 

*Why are we measuring it?* The **Risk Definition** clearly states what is at risk. In general, because the Council is charged with managing fisheries for Optimum Yield (OY), risk definitions often centered on a particular element's potential impact on achieving OY. However, some risk elements addressed additional Council objectives.

*How are we measuring it?* An **Indicator** is an observation that gives information about the risk element. It may be a time series of data or it may come from an individual study (even a previous risk assessment). 

Risk elements were organized into five categories: Ecological, Economic, Social, Food Production, Management. These categories align roughly with management objectives for US fisheries as specified in an integrated ecosystem assessment context [@depiper_operationalizing_2017]. Therefore, ecosytem, economic, and social indicators had already been identified and presented for many of the general management objectives in the region prior to development of the risk assessment (http://www.mafmc.org/s/Tab02_2017-04_State-of-the-Ecosystem-and-EAFM.pdf). 

After defining the assesment more clearly, the EOP and Advisors reached consensus on the list of Risk Elements, and had a preview of available indicators/information to evaluate risks for each element just prior to the October Council meeting. During the October Council meeting the following week, the full Council agreed on the list of risk elements to go forward for evaluation. 

Between the October and December Council meetings, analysts assembled indicators for each element from available sources, including the indicators from the State of the Ecosystem report presented to the Council earlier in 2017 (linked above), an estuarine habitat assessment [@us_epa_national_2012-1], a climate vulnerability analysis for species in the Northeast U.S. [@hare_vulnerability_2016], existing social vulnerability analyses [@colburn_social_2012; @jepson_development_2013], and a climate vulnerability analysis for northeast U.S. fishing communities [@colburn_indicators_2016]. Additional information came from literature searches and from expert opinion for some elements. Detailed sources for the final indicators selected by the Council are presented in sections below. Given these data sources and the Council-approved list of risk elements, the final analytical decision was how to translate the indicators and other data into a level of risk. 

*What is the risk?* The **Risk Ranking Criteria** were developed iteratively between analysts and the Council to use the available indicator(s). Analysts proposed initial criteria for low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk based on the elements and indicators available. For trend-based risk definitions, a Mann-Kendall test for monotonic trends was used to test significance (p<0.05) of both long term (full time series) and recent (2007-2016) trends. Autocorrelation in the time series was addressed by prewhitening the data as suggested by [@yue_influence_2002]. 

The proposed risk ranking criteria were then presented to the EOP and advisors at a meeting in early December 2017. We note that for many risk elements, there are no established risk thresholds for low, low-moderate, moderate-high, or high risk, so the consensus of the Council and committee were used to establish risk levels. The EOP discussed the proposed risk ranking criteria for each element, and modifed them as necessary to reflect a ranking rationale aligned with their risk tolerance. If clear thresholds become available for any element/indicator combination, they can be substituted into future assessments. Similarly, if the risk tolerance of the Council changes over time, the ranking criteria can be similarly adjusted. 

Upon review of available indicator data in early December, the EOP also identified several indicators that they considered either preliminary or unreliable based on their experience. Therefore, the elements associated with these indicators were not rated in this assessment, but are still under consideration for future assessments. 
At the December 2017 Council Meeting, the full Council reached agreement on ranking criteria of elements and the results of risk assessment based on those criteria. As a result of the full (August-December) process, the Council finalized a range of risk elements to be evaluated at either the managed species level, the species and sector level, or the ecosystem level. An overview of the risk elements with definitions and associated indicators as adopted by the MAFMC is presented in as the first result of this assessment. In the following results sections, we describe each risk element in more detail along with Council-specified definitions of low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk. Indicators are then shown for each risk element and a risk categorization based on the indicator is presented. At the end of the results section, we summarize risk ranking results across elements in three tables.

#Results
After several iterations with stakeholders and analysts, the Council settled on 25 Risk Elements and definitions for evaluation in this assessment, in addition to indicators associated with each element (Table \ref{riskel}). Eight additional risk elements were considered by the Council, but ultimately removed from this initial assessment. These elements required either further specification, improved data availability, clearer interpretability, or some combination of these factors. The elements that were put aside at present are still of interest to the Council, and may be addressed in future assessments as information improves.

In sections below, each risk element is described and defined. The final risk ranking criteria agreed on by the Council for each element are outlined in the individual sections below, and summarized for all risk elements in Table \ref{allcriteria}. Each section also presents the indicator data used for the element and describes risk based on the risk ranking criteria. Summary results across all risk categories are presented in Table \ref{sptable} (species level), Table \ref{spsectable} (species and sector level), and Table \ref{ecotable} (ecosystem level).

## Ecological Elements

###Assessment Performance
This element is applied at the species level. Other risk elements (F status and B status) describe risks according to our best understanding of stock status, but assessment methods and data quality shape our understanding. This risk element addresses risk to achieving OY due to scientific uncertainty based on analytical limitations. The MAFMC risk policy accounts for scientific uncertainty in assessments, with methods for determining scientific uncertainty currently being refined by the Scientific and Statistical Committee. Ranking for this risk element will be adjusted if necessary to ensure consistency with SSC methods in the future.

Low risk criteria for assessment performance were that stock assessment model(s) passed peer review, and stocks have high data quality. Low-Moderate risk criteria were that assessment passed peer review, but some key data and/or reference points may be lacking. The Moderate-High risk category was not used for this element. High risk critera for assessmnt performance were that the assessment failed peer review, that there was no assessment, and/or that data-limited tools were applied.

-->

Stocks with low risk due to assessment performance include ocean quahog, surf clam, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, butterfish, golden tilefish, and bluefish. Squids and dogfish are assessed with index-based assessment methods which rank low-moderate risk due to incomplete survey coverage in some years, and reference points for squids are lacking. The monkfish 2016 operational assessment was unable to model growth or population status due to innacurate ageing methods, so both northern and southern stocks rank high risk for this element. At present, blueline tilefish ranks high risk for assessment type because it is assessed with the data limited methods (DLM) toolbox. *Atlantic mackerel had been assessed with the DLM toolbox and is ranked highest risk, but an age-structured benchmark assessment was peer-reviewed in November 2017 which may change this ranking.*

###F status and B status
These elements are applied at the species level. Fishing mortality (F) rates and biomass (B) levels relative to established reference points from assessments indicate the level of risk to achieving OY from either overfishing or stock depletion (respectively). 

Clearly defined low and high risk criteria already exist for these elements based on U.S. law, so we applied them here. Low risk criteria are F < Fmsy and B > Bmsy for an individual stock. High risk criteria are F > Fmsy and B < 0.5Bmsy for an individiual stock. The Council established the intermediate risk categories to address stocks with unknown status. Moderate-high risk was defined as unknown status in the absence of other information for both F and B. Low-moderate risk was defined as unknown, but with a weight of evidence indicating low overfishing risk for F. Similarly, low-moderate risk criteria for B were either 0.5Bmsy < B < Bmsy or unknown but with a weight of evidence indicating low risk that the population is depleted.

Current assessment results for all MAFMC managed stocks are summarized in Fig. \ref{KOBE}. Based on these results, F and B status are both in the low risk category for surfclams, ocean quahogs, scup, black sea bass, and butterfish. Bluefish, golden tilefish, and spiny dogfish F status is in the low risk category, and B risk is in the low-moderate risk category. Summer flounder F status is in the high risk category and B status is in the low-moderate risk category. F and B status for northern and southern goosefish stocks were formerly in the low risk categories, but a recent assessment update was unable to determine status, so we provisionally rank them low-moderate risk (unknown but weight of evidence supports lower risk). Longfin squid B is above the established B threshold, and both squid stocks have unknown F status, but F is difficult to estimate because it is very low relative to natural mortality, so they are also ranked low-moderate risk. Blueline tilefish are high risk for F status and have unknown B status and little auxiliary information in the Mid-Atlantic region, and so rank moderate-high risk for B status. Finally, Atlantic mackerel has moderate-high risk for both F and B status due both to failed assessment/unknown status and indications from recent analyses. *Atlantic mackerel status will be updated after benchmark assessment results are finalized in early 2018.*

###Food Web (MAFMC Predators)
This element is applied at the species level. This element ranks the risks of not achieving OY due to predator interactions between MAFMC managed species. To rank these risks, the "importance" of each species as predator must be assessed. There are not clear standardized threshold to define this. Diet information can be used to develop thresholds: an important predator of MAFMC managed species can be defined as having more than a threshold level of MAFMC managed species in the diet by weight. "Dependent" predators warranting a high risk ranking would have a majority (>50%) of diet from an individual MAFMC managed species. 

The EOP Committee agreed that high dependence on a single prey represented high risk to a predator, but could not come to agreement on thresholds for intermediate risk levels, so this risk ranking uses only low and high levels. Low risk criteria were few interactions as predators of other Council managed species, or predator of other managed species in aggregate but below 50% of diet. High risk criteria were that a managed species was highly dependent on other MAFMC managed species as prey (50%+ of diet).

This information is gathered from the NEFSC food habits database and other sources [@smith_trophic_2010; @johnson_growth_2008].  Surfclams and ocean quahogs are not predators of other MAFMC managed species, so they rank low risk for this element. Similarly, scup, black sea bass, and golden and blueline tilefish eat primarily benthic invertebrates. Summer flounder, spiny dogfish, bluefish, and monkfish are predators of MAFMC managed species, but do not meet the threshold of >50% of diet. Summer flounder prey on other MAFMC managed species, including longfin and other squid, Atlantic mackerel, scup, and butterfish (not resolved in food web; combined diet >30%). Dogfish have ~20% of total diet from squids and mackerel, bluefish have ~25% of diet from butterfish, squids, bluefish, mackerel, and scup, and monkfish have ~20% of diet from squids, mackerel, summer flounder, scup, and monkfish. Therefore, these three predators rank low risk for food web interactions with other MAFMC managed species. 

###Food Web (MAFMC Prey)
This element is applied at the species level. This element ranks the risks of not achieving OY due to prey interactions between MAFMC managed species. To rank these risks, the "importance" of each species as prey must be assessed. There are not clear standardized threshold to define this. Diet information and a food web model can be used to develop thresholds. An important prey of MAFMC managed species can be defined as individually comprising above a certain threshold of the predator's diet by weight. "Vulnerable" prey warranting a high risk ranking would comprise a majority (>50%) of diet or have a majority of mortality caused by an individual MAFMC managed species. 

The EOP Committee agreed that a high proportion in diet represented high risk as a prey (and also to the predator), but could not come to agreement on thresholds for intermediate risk levels. However, management measures designed to protect forage species were viewed as lowering inherent risk. Low risk criteria were few interactions as prey of other MAFMC managed species, or prey of other managed species but below 50% of diet. Low-moderate risk criteria were that an important prey had management consideration of interaction. High risk criteria were that the managed species is sole prey and/or subject to high mortality due to other MAFMC managed species.

This information is gathered from the NEFSC food habits database and other sources [@smith_trophic_2010; @johnson_growth_2008].  Surfclams and ocean quahogs are not prey of other MAFMC managed species, so they rank low risk for this element. Similarly, spiny dogfish, bluefish, monkfish, summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, and golden and blueline tilefish do not show up individually as >10% of prey by weight in any MAFMC managed species diets, so they rank low risk. While some MAFMC managed species are prey of other managed species, none meet the defined risk threshold, so all are ranked low risk. Atlantic mackerel is a prey of spiny dogfish (~10% of diet with high interannual variability). Butterfish is a prey of bluefish, but is below the threshold (~12% of diet), and the reference point applied to butterfish considers it's role as a forage fish in general. Cephalopods as a group are prey of summer flounder (~33% of diet), with approximately half of this attributed to "*Loligo* species" in the diet data, very little to *Illex* species, and the rest as squid unidentified. Similarly, Cephalopods as a group are important prey of shortfin squid (>30% of diet), but how much of this is longfin squid is unknown, and some is cannibalism. Unmanaged forage (e.g. anchovies, sandlance, >50% of inshore diet) are important prey of bluefish, but MAFMC measures restict fishery development on these species so they rank low-moderate risk under this element. 

###Food Web (Protected Species Prey)
This element is applied at the species level. This element ranks the risks of not achieving protected species objectives due to species interactions with MAFMC managed species. As above, a food web model and updated marine mammal diet information can be used to establish thresholds of "importance" for predators and prey. There are no MAFMC managed species that are important predators of protected species, so here we rank only risks where MAFMC managed species represent prey of protected species. An important prey of protected species is defined here as individually comprising >30% of the predator's diet by weight. "Dependent" predators and prey warranting a high risk ranking would have a majority (>50%) of diet or mortality caused by an individual protected species.

Protected species include marine mammals (under the Marine Mammal Protection Act), Endangered and Threatened species (under the Endangered Species Act), and migratory birds (under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act). In the Northeast US, endangered/threatened species include Atlantic salmon, Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, all sea turtle species, and 5 baleen whales. MAFMC managed species are not important predators of protected species [@smith_trophic_2010], even though monkfish occasionally ingest seabirds [@perry_predation_2013]. Atlantic salmon, both species of sturgeon, and sea turtles are not major predators of MAFMC managed species, as reviewed in the MAFMC Forage Fish white paper [@savoy_prey_2007; @johnson_food_1997; @burke_diet_1993; @burke_diet_1994; @mcclellan_complexity_2007; @seney_historical_2007; @shoop_seasonal_1992]. Information sources for marine mammal diets in the Northeast US [@smith_consumption_2015], and seabird diets [@powers_pelagic_1983; @powers_energy_1987; @powers_seabirds_1987; @schneider_state_1996; @barrett_diet_2007; @bowser_puffins_2013] were reviewed. 

Because protected species is a multispecies category, risk ranking criteria were developed to address interactions across species. Low risk ranking criteria were few interactions with any protected species. Low-Moderate risk criteria were that an MAFMC managed species was important prey of 1-2 protected species, or important prey of 3 or more protected species with management consideration of interaction. Moderate-High risk criteria were that an MAFMC managed species was important prey of 3 or more protected species. Finally, High risk criteria was that a MAFMC managed species is sole prey for a protected species. 

Diet information for protected species tends to be more uncertain than for fished species, so we consider diet at the family level for these rankings because diet compositions are not reported to the species level. Longfin squids are estimated to comprise >30% of diet for one protectes species, pilot whale, in the Northeast US [@smith_consumption_2015; @gannon_stomach_1997], therefore we rank this species low-moderate risk for this element. Shortfin squid were identified as important prey for two pelagic seabirds in the Northeast US [@powers_energy_1987], and therefore ranked low-moderate risk. Unmanaged forage fish such as sand lance and saury were identified as important prey for >3 seabird species in the Northeast US [@powers_energy_1987], as well as grey seals [@smith_consumption_2015]. MAFMC has enacted measures to restrict fishing on these species, such that they rank low-moderate risk for this element. Other MAFMC managed species do not meet the threshold of important prey of protected species based on available information, so they rank low risk for this element.

###Ecosystem Productivity
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element ranks the risk of not achieving OY due to changes in ecosystem productivity at the base of the food web. Four indicators are used together to assess risk of changing ecosystem productivity. We examine trends in total primary production, zooplankton abundance for a key Mid-Atlantic species, and two aggregate fish productivity measures: condition factor (weight divided by length of individual fish) and a survey based "recruitment" (small fish to large fish) index. Because many MAFMC managed species rely on benthic crustaceans as forage, a benthic production indicator is also desirable, but not yet available.

Low risk criteria for this element were no trends in ecosystem productivity across all four indicators. Low-Moderate risk criteria were trend(s) in ecosystem productivity for 1-2 indicators, whether increasing or decreasing. Moderate-High risk criteria were trends in ecosystem productivity (3+ measures, increase or decrease). High risk criteria were decreasing trends across all 4 indicators.

For primary production and fish productivity, the spatial scale of analysis is the Mid-Atlantic Ecosystem Production Unit, as indicated in Figure \ref{EPUmap}. 

####Primary production  
Primary production has fluctuated recently with current conditions near average (Fig. \ref{ecoprod}, top left). The observed stability in system productivity is in contrast to an apparent shift in the timing of the bloom cycle in the Mid-Atlantic. Comparing remote sensing information from the 1970-80s to recent information suggest that winter productivity was higher in the MAB and that the spring bloom we see today was not as prominent. This change in phytoplankton seasonal biomass may be related to the changes seen in the zooplankton community (see below) suggesting a grazing effect; but, whatever the mechanism associated with these changes, shifts in timing of low trophic level production can affect resource fish species and their early life history stages that feed on zooplankton.
<!--

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'PPbloomtiming.png'))

```
-->

####Zooplankton  
<!--Zooplankton provide a critical link between phytoplankton at the base of the food web, and higher trophic organisms such as fish, mammals, and birds. Changes in the species compostion and biomass of the zooplankton community have a great potential to affect recruitment success and fisheries productivity, and climate change may be the most important pathway for these changes to manifest. Therefore these indices are relevant to both productivity and trophic structure objectives.-->  

Zooplankton surveys have been conducted since the 1970s and have been most consistently executed in the spring and fall seasons coinciding with the NEFSC bottom trawl survey. The time series of zooplankton biovolume suggest that overall zooplankton production has not changed over time. However, the dominant species of zooplankton in the MAB, *Centropages typicus* shows a seasonal shift in abundance (Fig. \ref{ecoprod}, top right), suggesting a change in timing of zooplankton reproductive cycles, which may be impacting fish species such as mackerel.
<!--

opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(4, 6, 2, 6))
soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'Centropages typicus spring', stacked = 'A', tol = 0.03,
         rel.y.num = 0.9, scale.axis = 10^3)
soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'Centropages typicus fall', stacked = 'B', tol = 0.03, 
         rel.y.num = 0.9, scale.axis = 10^3)

soe.stacked.axis('Year', expression('thousands per 100 m' ^ 3), rel.y.text = 1.1,
                 y.line = 3)

```
-->

####Fish condition
Fish condition is measured as the weight per length--a measure of "fatness". This information is from NEFSC bottom trawl surveys and shows a change in condition across all species at around 2000 (Fig. \ref{ecoprod}, bottom left). Around 2010-2013 many species started to have better condition, while black sea bass remain thinner for their length on average.
<!--

#I will get the actual code here eventually but just don't have time right now
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'MAFMC_Fish_Condition.jpg'))

```
-->

####Fish productivity
The number of small fish relative to the biomass of larger fish of the same species from the NEFSC survey is a simple measure of productivity, intended to complement model-based stock assessment estimates of recruitment for commercial species. There is a general decrease in this indicator when aggregated across managed and unmanaged species in the Mid-Atlantic (Fig. \ref{ecoprod}, bottom right). The plot includes black sea bass, butterfish, clearnose skate, fourspot flounder, little skate, scup, spiny dogfish, summer flounder, thorny skate, windowpane, winter flounder, and winter skate.

<!--
```{r, fig.cap="Fish productivity: Anomalies of recruit abundance per spawner biomass for species in the MAB. Annual anomalies shown are the average of spring and fall anomalies. \\label{fishprodsurvey}", echo = F, fig.align='center', out.width='0.7\\linewidth', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'FishProdMAB.pdf'))
#knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'fishprodlegend.pdf'))

```
-->

To summarize, primary production shows no trend (although the seasonal timing of primary production may be changing). Similarly, there are no trends in overall zooplankton abundance, but a dominant Mid-Atlantic species shows different trends by season, possibly also indicating a shift in timing. Fish condition showed a drop across all species in the early 2000s, but most species appear to have recovered. There is a decreasing trend in aggregate numbers of small fish per large fish (Fig. \ref{ecoprod}). This one clear trend, along with changes in timing at lower trophic levels, suggest a low-moderate risk of changing ecosystem productivity in the Mid-Atlantic region.

###Population diversity
This element is applied at the species level. Changes (particularly reduction) in diversity at the species/stock level (size, sex, reproductive). *Needs data workup by species, may not all be done by Oct BUT PRIORITIZE SUMMER FLOUNDER age/size diversity*

```{r riskpopdiv, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

Picture of indicator, reference, or words describing rankings.

###Ecological diversity
This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and therefore poses the same risk to each species. The Council identified changes (particularly reduction) in species diversity as a risk element. Diversity in species composition mainly addresses risks related to maintaining ecosystem structure and stability; maintaining diversity (here estimated as the mean number of species found in a random sample of 100 fish at a station for the Mid-Atlantic portion of NEFSC surveys) can provide the capacity to adapt to change at the ecosystem level and for dependent fishing communities. 

```{r riskecodiv, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

Diversity shows a significant increase for one season in the Mid-Atlantic, suggesting that survey timing may be interacting with changes in the seasonal movement of fish (see above) as well as a potential change in species availability due to distribution shifts (see below). However, additional analysis is required to ensure that the transition between survey vessels did not affect this metric. Therefore, while the criteria above would indicate a moderate-high risk of changing species diversity in the region, we rank this low-moderate risk until further analysis of the ship effect is complete.

###Climate
This element is applied at the species level. Risks to species productivity (and therefore to achieving OY) due to projected climate change in the Northeast US were evaluated in a comprehensive assessment [@hare_vulnerability_2016]. This assessment evaluated exposure of each species to multiple climate threats, including ocean and air temperature, ocean acidification, ocean salinity, ocean currents, precipitation, and sea level rise. The assessment also evaluated the sensitivity (*not extinction risk*) of each species based on habitat and prey specificity, sensitivity to temperature and ocean acidification, multiple life history factors, and number of non-climate stressors. This assessment is intended to be conducted iteratively, so these results can be updated in the future. 
<!--

Mid-Atlantic species were all either highly or very highly exposed to climate risk in this region, and ranged from low to very high sensitivity to expected climate change in the Northeast US. The combination of exposure and sensitivity results in the overall vulnerability ranking. We applied those climate vulnerability rankings directly here as risk ranking criteria. <!--(Fig. \ref{NEVAvul}).--> 

Low risk ranking criteria was a low climate vulnerability ranking. Low-Moderate risk criteria was a moderate climate vulnerability ranking. Moderate-High risk criteria was a high climate vulnerability ranking. High risk criteria was a very high climate vulnerability ranking.

```
-->

While this risk assessment focuses on overall vulnerability to impacts of climate, not all impacts will be negative. Some MAFMC managed species may benefit from projected future climate conditions, including black sea bass, bluefish, butterfish, longfin squid, and shortfin squid [@hare_vulnerability_2016]. 

###Distribution Shifts
This element is applied at the species level. Species distribution shifts can increase risks of ineffective spatial catch allocation; if catch distribution is greatly mismatched with species distribution OY may not be achieved. Risks of species distribution shifts due to projected climate change in the Northeast US were assessed in a comprehensive assessment [@hare_vulnerability_2016]. We applied those distribution shift risk rankings directly here, as explained above. In addition, changes in species distribution are monitored using fisheries independent bottom trawl surveys. Two distribution shift indicators are derived from these surveys: kernel density plots of recent distribution compared with 1970s distribution, and time series of the along shelf position of the center of distribution.

####Historical vs. Current Distribution Maps
Spatial distribution has changed over time for some species more than for others. Black sea bass distributions measured by NEFSC surveys have shifted northward relative to historical distributions. In contrast, longfin squid distributions in the Mid-Atlantic have remained relatively stable.

####Changes in Along Shelf Position
Species distribution on the NE Shelf can be characterized by the position in the ecosystem along an axis oriented from the southwest to the northeast, referred to as the along shelf distance, and by depth. Along shelf distances range from 0 to 1360, which relates to positions along the axis from the origin in the southwest to the northeast in kilometer units. The mean along shelf distance for several MAFMC species by year is shown below; most are consistent with the predictions of NEVA and show a northeastward change in distribution aside from squids (Fig. \ref{shifts}).  Mean depth has not changed significantly for these species. Information for more species is available at http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/ecosys/current-conditions/species-dist.html. 

###Estuarine and Coastal Habitat
This element is applied at the species level. Risk of not achieving OY due to threats to estuarine and nearshore coastal habitat/nursery grounds was determined by first evaluating the estuarine dependence of species, and then by enumerating threats to the estuarine habitat required by these species. Here, we include estuarine and nearshore coastal habitat in the term "estuarine" below. Water and habitat quality assessments produced for Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Long Island Sound and other coastal estuaries can be considered in the future.

Low risk ranking criteria were species not dependent on nearshore coastal or estuarine habitat. Low-Moderate risk criteria were estuarine dependent species with estuarine condition stable. Moderate-High risk criteria were estuarine dependent species with estuarine condition fair. High risk criteria were estuarine dependent species with estuarine condition poor. 

As a start, the US EPA National Coastal Condition Assessment for the Northeast US [@us_epa_national_2012] was used to evaluate estuarine and coastal condition. This report lists water, sediment, benthic, and coastal habitat quality as well as fish contamination. Northeast US coastal waters in the Mid-Atlantic region rated fair to poor for water quality, fair for sediment quality, poor for benthic quality, good to fair for coastal habitat, and fair to poor for fish contamination. These ratings were based on nearshore and estuarine summer sampling 2003-2006. The overall coastal condition was rated fair for the entire region, but this includes offshore conditions which we address in the next element. Therefore, estuarine and nearshore coastal habitat dependent species (summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, and bluefish, [@able_re-examination_2005]) were ranked high risk based on overall poor estuarine condition for this element, and all others were ranked low risk due to lower dependence on this habitat type. 

###Offshore Habitat
This element is applied at the species level. The risk of achieving OY due to changes in offshore habitat quality and quantity can be assessed using trends derived from experimental species-specific habitat modeling. *In addition, the number of threats from other human uses can be enumerated; at present this is addressed under "Other Ocean Uses" in the Management section below.*

Low risk critiera were no change in offshore habitat quality or quantity. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing variability in habitat quality or quantity. Moderate-High risk criteria was a significant long term decrease in habitat quality or quantity. High risk criteria was a significant recent decrease in habitat quality or quantity. 

Habitat models using both static and dynamics variables have been developed for many of the resource species on the Northeast Shelf. These models estimate spring and fall habitat for the time series 1992 to 2016 reflecting the use of the ecosystem based on the NEFSC bottom trawl survey. The variables evaluated for use in these models included station salinity, station temperature, benthic complexity, satellite derived chlorophyll concentration and sea surface temperature, the gradient magnitude (front structure) of the satellite data, and zooplankton bio-volume and taxa abundance with station depth included in all models. The random forest approach differentiates variables with strong predictive power and was used to reduce the variable set to 11 variables for each species. The models were used to estimate fall habitat scores over the entire shelf over the time series.

<!--Spring and fall habitat trends for Northeast Shelf species over the time period 1992 to 2016 were evaluated using the number square km in a single habitat interval from habitat modeling.  Fall indices for MAFMC species are below, with spring on the following page. *mapping linear model slope estimates for grid locations constrained to the segment of the shelf used by each species. These segments were estimated as a 99% kernel density shapes based on occurrence of each species during the study period.* -->

*This experimental habitat index is still being studied and improved, so habitat risk rankings based on this are considered preliminary by the EOP, and are not included in the final risk assessment.* 

Overall, black sea bass, summer flounder, and scup have long term increasing trends in fall offshore habitat, and dogfish, butterfish, Atlantic mackerel and longfin squid have short term increasing trends. Goosefish has no significant trend in fall offshore habitat. Therefore, these species rank low risk for this element. However, shortfin squid has a long term and a short term decreasing trend in offshore habitat. Therefore, shortfin squid ranks high risk for this element. 

Ocean quahogs, surfclams, tilefish, and bluefish are not adequately sampled by the bottom trawl survey and were not included in this analysis, similar to unmanaged forage and deepsea corals. Sessile species in particular may be highly vulnerable to habitat changes, so assessments of their habitat are particularly important to develop.

##Economic Elements

###Commercial Revenue
This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and addresses the risk of not maximizing fishery value. Revenue serves as a proxy for commercial profits, which is the component of a fishery's value that this element is ultimately attempting to assess risk towards. 

Risk ranking critiera for time series followed a similar pattern across ecological, economic, and social indicators if decreasing trends were considered risky. Low risk criteria were no trend and low variability in revenue. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing variability or overall high variability in revenue. Moderate-High risk criteria was a significant long term revenue decrease. High risk criteria was a significant recent decrease in revenue.

-->

Aggregate commercial revenue for MAFMC managed species was calculated (Fig. \ref{econinds}, Upper left). There is a long term significant decrease in revenue, indicating moderate-high risk to commercial fishery profit. This trend is consistent with the trend first shown in the EAFM Interactions white paper and published in @gaichas_framework_2016 (Figs 2-3).

```

###Marine Recreational Angler Days/Trips
This element is applied at both the fleet level and at the ecosystem level where it would apply equally to all recreationally fished species. Angler days and trips are proxies for the welfare (value) generated from recreational fishing. Risk of not maximizing fishery value is evaluated using the number of marine recreational fishing angler-days and number of marine recreational trips, in aggregate.
<!--
```{r riskrecval, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trends in angler days/trips |
| Low-Moderate | Increasing or high variability in angler days/trips |
| Moderate-High | Significant long term decreases in angler days/trips |
| High | Significant recent decreases in angler days/trips |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```
-->
Low risk criteria were no trend and low variability in angler days/trips. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing variability or overall high variability in angler days/trips. Moderate-High risk criteria were significant long term decreases in angler days/trips. High risk criteria were significant recent decreases in angler days/trips. 

Providing recreational opportunities is a stated goal of optimal fishery management as part of the definition of "benefits to the nation" under MSA. Recreational fishing is important in the Mid-Atlantic region with many coastal communities having high recreational dependence. Although there is an overall trend of increasing recreational fishery participation  in terms of number of anglers, the most recent 10 years has shown a striking decline in both recreation indices (Fig. \ref{econinds}, Lower left). 
<!--
```{r RecParticipation, fig.cap="A: number of anglers, B: number of trips \\label{recreation}", echo = F, fig.height=3.5, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(4, 6, 2, 6))
soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'Mid-Atlantic Rec participation', x.end = 2016,
         scale.axis = 10^6, rel.y.num = 0.8, stacked = 'A')
soe.plot(SOE.data, 'Time', 'Mid-Atlantic angler trips', x.end = 2016,
         scale.axis = 10^6, rel.y.num = 0.8, stacked = 'B')

soe.stacked.axis('Year', expression('Recreational participation, 10'^6*'n'),
                 rel.y.text = .8)

```
-->

These significant recent decreases in numbers of anglers and numbers of trips alone suggest high risk to recreational value generated from the species with substantial recreational fisheries (summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, bluefish). This is a national trend likely due to shifting demographics and general economic dynamics, among other issues.

###Commercial Fishery Resilience (Revenue Diversity)
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element addresses the risk of reduced commercial fishery business resilience by evaluating species diversity of revenue at the permit level. 
<!--
```{r riskfrel1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |

cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion

-->

Low risk criteria were no trend and low variability in the diversity measure. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing variability or overall high variability in the diversity measure. Moderate-High risk criteria was a significant long term decrease in the diversity measure. High risk criteria was a significant recent decrease in the diversity measure. 

This diversity index is the average effective Shannon index for species revenue at the permit level, for all permits landing any amount of MAFMC FMP species within a year (including both Monkfish and Spiny Dogfish). Although the exact value of the effective Shannon index is relatively uninformative, the major change in diversity seems to have occurred in the late 1990’s, with much of the recent index relatively stable.

###Commercial Fishery Resilience (Shoreside Support)
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element ranks the risk of reduced fishery business resilience due to shoreside support infrastructure by examining the number of shoreside support businesses. 
<!--
```{r riskfrel4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |

-->

Low risk criteria were no trend and low variability in the number of shoreside support businesses. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing variability or overall high variability in shoreside support businesses. Moderate-High risk criteria was a significant recent decrease in one measure of shoreside support businesses. High risk criteria was a significant recent decrease in multiple measures of shoreside support businesses. 

The number of shoreside support businesses were tallied for all Mid-Atlantic states in two categories: number of companies (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Obtained September 27, 2017. US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. https://www.bls.gov/cew/home.htm) and number of non-employer entities Nonemployer Statistics.” Obtained September 28, 2017. U.S. Census Bureau.
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nonemployer-statistics.html), which we consider separately. Nonemployer entities are businesses that have no paid employees (i.e. the owner is the workforce), while the shoreside support companies include all businesses with paid employees. Some state level data was not included due to confidentiality.

The number of shoreside support companies that include seafood merchant wholesalers, seafood product preparation and packaging, and seafood markets across all Mid-Atlantic states shows a significant long term and short term decrease, which on its own represents moderate-high risk to fishery resilience. However, the number of non-employer entities which include seafood preparation and packaging and seafood markets shows a long term increase (Fig. \ref{econinds}, Lower right). Trends in other shoreside fishery supporting businesses such as gear manufacturers and welding companies are not included here due to aggregation of the statistics.

###Commercial Employment
This element is applied at the state level. This element ranks the risk of not optimizing employment opportunities in the commercial sector. Risks were assessed by examining time series of employment information from Fisheries Economics of the U.S. [@nmfs_fisheries_2017]. A full description of the model generating employment estimates can be found here:  http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/documents/commercial_seafood_impacts_2007-2009.pdf

Low risk criteria were no trends in employment. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing or high variability in employment. Moderate-High risk criteria was a  significant recent decrease in employment for one state. High risk criteria were significant recent decreases in employment for multiple states. 

The EOP Committee lacked confidence in the available employment indicator data, so this element remains unranked at this time.

<!--
This is commercial employment by state.

Based on this state-level information, most states show no trend in commercial fishery employment, but there is a significant recent decrease in employment in one state, Virginia. Therefore, this element ranks moderate-high risk. New York and New Jersey went from the hightest to lowest employment numbers within the most recent 2-4 years, suggesting increasing variability.

##Social-Cultural Elements

###Fleet Diversity
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element ranks the risk to maintaining equity in access to fishery resources. Two indicators of commercial fleet diversity, including the number of distinct fleets and diversity of revenue across fleets are used in combination to evaluate current fleet resilience throughout the Mid-Atlantic region. 

Maintaining diversity can provide the capacity to adapt to change at the ecosystem level for dependent fishing communities, and can address objectives related to stability. Below are diversity estimates for fleets landing MAFMC-managed species. This measure identifies the diversity in revenue generated by different fleet segments. A fleet is defined here as the combination of gear code (Scallop Dredge, Other Dredge, Gillnet, Hand Gear, Longline, Bottom Trawl, Midwater Trawl, Pot, Purse Seine, or Clam Dredge) and vessel length category (Less than 30 ft, 30 to 50 ft, 50 to 75 feet, 75 ft and above).

Low risk criteria were no trend and low variability in the diversity measure. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing variability or overall high variability in the diversity measure. Moderate-High risk criteria was a significant long term decrease in the diversity measure. High risk criteria was a significant recent decrease in the diversity measure.

A declining trend in diversity indicates a less diverse fleet is currently active in MAFMC-managed fisheries. However, it cannot distinguish whether specialization (by choice), or alternatively stovepiping (constrained choices), is occurring in the Northeastern Large Marine Ecosystem, rather merely that the fleet composition is changing, which might warrant additional scrutiny.

At the request of the EOP and advisors, the diversity metrics were also calculated giving less weight to the scallop and clam fleets. However, the overall trends are very similar.

-->
There is a long term decrease in the fleet count metric. Therefore this element ranks moderate-high risk. The number of fleets in the Mid-Atlantic seems to be negatively correlated to the revenue diversity metric in the most recent five years, which indicates that the latter results are being dominated by changes in the distribution of revenue across fleets, as opposed to the number of active fleets.

###Community Vulnerability
The NOAA Fisheries Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs; @jepson_development_2013) are statistical measures of the vulnerability of communities to events such as regulatory changes to fisheries, wind farms, and other ocean-based businesses, as well as to natural hazards, disasters, and climate change. The CSVIs currently serve as indicators of social vulnerability, gentrification pressure vulnerability, commercial and recreational fishing dependence (with dependence being a function of both reliance and engagement), sea level rise risk, species vulnerability to climate change, and catch composition diversity. We use a combination of these five indicators for the most fishery dependent communities to evaluate overall social risk levels.

Low risk ranking critiera were few (<10%) vulnerable fishery dependent communities. Low-Moderate risk criteria were 10-25% of fishery dependent communities with >3 high vulnerability ratings. Moderate-High risk criteria were 25-50% of fishery dependent communities with >3 high vulnerability ratings. High risk criteria were a majority (>50%) of fishery dependent communities with >3 high vulnerability ratings. 

Below is a brief description for each vulnerability category based on the NOAA social indicator study [@jepson_development_2013; @colburn_indicators_2016]:

* **Fishing dependence** indices portray the importance or level of dependence of commercial or recreational fishing to coastal communities. 
*	**Social vulnerability** indices represent social factors that can shape either an individual or community’s ability to adapt to change. These factors exist within all communities regardless of the importance of fishing. 
*	**Gentrification pressure** indices characterize those factors that, over time may indicate a threat to commercial or recreational working waterfront, including infrastructure. 

Communities are ranked as high, medium high, moderate, or low relative to the respective indicator (Table \ref{reliance}). Community dependence on commercial and recreational fishing is mixed, with notably more communities in the Mid-Atlantic dependent on recreational fishing. While communities with high to medium high risk for social vulnerability are broadly distributed in suburban and rural areas of the Mid-Atlantic region, communities with high to medium high gentrification pressure are concentrated in beachfront communities near urban areas in New York and New Jersey. 

The social and economic impacts of climate change have been modeled through application of social indicators of fishing dependent communities [@jepson_development_2013]. Assessment of a range of social indicators has been applied in the Mid-Atlantic Region to predict vulnerability of communities to regulatory changes and disasters.  More recently this methodology has been extended to include specific indicators of vulnerability to climate change and linked to species vulnerability assessments [@colburn_indicators_2016; @hare_vulnerability_2016]. The tools developed through this approach are vital to an evaluation of the risks of climate change facing coastal communities dependent on fishing. Below is a description of the CSVIs related to climate change.

*	**Sea Level Rise Index** is a measure of the overall risk of inundation from sea level rise based on community area lost from one to six foot level projections over the next ~90 years. A high rank indicates a community more vulnerable to sea level rise.
* **Species Vulnerability** is measured by the proportion of community fish landings that attributed to species vulnerable to climate change. 
* **Catch Composition Diversity** is the relative abundance of species landed in a community. It is measured by Simpson’s Reciprocal Index, and a higher index value indicates greater diversity. Communities with a diverse array of species landed may be less vulnerable to climate change. 

Sea level rise is predicted to have variable impacts on coastal communities. The Mid-Atlantic region has a 3-4 times higher than global average sea level rise rate (Sallenger et al. 2012). Mid-Atlantic communities clustered around the Chesapeake Bay area and the New Jersey shore had especially high vulnerability to sea level rise (Fig. \ref{commrisk}). These vulnerabilities include infrastructure (docks, marinas, bait shops, gear storage) and access to shore-based facilities due realignment of coastal communities.

Mid-Atlantic fishing communities with total landings value of $100,000 or more were mapped for their dependence on species vulnerable to climate change and catch composition diversity (Simpson Reciprocal Index). A number of communities in southern New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia are highly dependent on species such as clams that are highly vulnerable to climate change while displaying low catch composition diversity. Communities with this situation are considered more vulnerable to climate change in general.

While the maps provide an overview of the social and climate indicator results for the Mid-Atlantic coastal communities, Table \ref{community} identifies Mid-Atlantic communities that are most highly dependent on both commercial and recreational fishing. The varying vulnerability level to social factors, gentrification pressure, and climate change in these communities provide a more comprehensive profile and should be taken into account in the decision making process for fishery management. 

As a preliminary risk assessment, rankings from Table \ref{community} of MedHigh or High were tallied for social vulnerability and gentrification pressure, along with rankings of High risk from sea level rise, High/Very High species vulnerability, and rankings of Low catch composition diversity. Four of these communities (20%) have three or more of these high risk rankings, so we rank overall social-cultural risk as low-moderate for these Mid-Atlantic communities.

##Food Production Elements

###Commercial Seafood Provision
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element describes the risk of not optimizing domestic seafood production from MAFMC managed species. Commercial seafood landings (as opposed to total landings which include bait and industrial uses) were used to assess seafood provision.

Low risk ranking criteria were no trend, or an increase in seafood landings. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing or high variability in seafood landings. Moderate-High risk criteria was a significant long term decrease in seafood landings. High risk crtieria was a significant recent decrease in seafood landings.
<!--

Commercial seafood landings from MAFMC managed species were assembled (Fig. \ref{seafood}, Left). Because this is total landings, years prior to 1977 do include foreign landings (in particular, of Atlantic mackerel, which account for much of the observed spike). Recent landings are all domestic fisheries. Looking across all regions, there is a significant recent decrease in seafood landings, indicating high risk to regional domestic seafood production.

```
-->

###Recreational/Subsistence Food Provision
This element is applied at the ecosystem level. This element describes the risk of not maintaining personal food production. Recreational seafood landings (as opposed to total landings which include catch and release that are captured under other risk elements/indicators) were used to assess food use of recreationally caught fish.
<!--

Low risk ranking criteria were no trend, or an increase in recreational seafood landings. Low-Moderate risk criteria were increasing or high variability in recreational seafood landings. Moderate-High risk criteria was a significant long term decrease in recreational seafood landings. High risk crtieria was a significant recent decrease in recreational seafood landings.

Total recreational harvest (all species) in the Mid-Atlantic region was evaluated (Fig. \ref{seafood}, Right).
<!--
```{r RecFood, fig.cap="A: Total recreational harvest, B: Harvest per angler  \\label{recfood}", echo = F, fig.height=3.5}

soe.stacked.axis('Year', 'N Recreationally Harvested Fish',rel.y.text = 1)
```
--> 

This significant long term decrease in both recreational landings and recreational landings per angler represents a moderate-high risk to food production.

<!--
##Seafood Safety
This element is applied at the species level. This element describes the risk to market access (e.g. spiny dogfish EU market; surfclam on GB and PSP) as well as potential risks to human health. The number of advisories https://fishadvisoryonline.epa.gov/General.aspx for an MAFMC managed species is evaluated to determine risk. If trend information becomes available, that could be used as well. *this needs legwork may not complete by October*

##Management Elements

###Fishing Mortality Control
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the level of management control in terms of catch estimation (measurement) and monitoring to prevent overfishing. Adequate management control indicates a low risk of overfishing, while poor management control indicates a higher risk of overfishing and hence not achieving OY.  Actual catch is compared with the specified ABC over the most recent five years of fishery history.
<!--
```{r riskctl, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No history of overages |
| Low-Moderate | Small overages, but infrequent |
| Moderate-High | Routine overages, but small to moderate |
| High | Routine significant overages |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```
-->

The ability to control total annual catch is necessary to prevent overfishing (i.e., defined to occur when total catch exceeds the overfishing level defined in the FMP), which is a fundamental requirement of MSA. Chronic or persistent overfishing can lead to stock depletion and ultimately to a stock being declared as overfished (thus requiring a stock rebuilding plan).  The ability to constrain catch is a function of the efficacy of the catch monitoring program for each species which relies on both proactive (in -season closure) and reactive (pay backs for overages in subsequent years) accountability measures which were implemented post-MSA Reauthorization. Under certain circumstances, specification of management measures which are too strict could lead to “underfishing” (not achieving the desired quota) and hence not achieving OY. 

This element was evaluated by fishery sector (commercial and recreational). For the commercial fishery, NMFS dealer data in conjunction with estimates of discards are used to compare target to actual annual catch. For the recreational sector, MRIP estimates of recreational catch are used to compare target to actual annual catch estimates. Small overages are defined as <5%, moderate as 5-10%, and significant overages as >10%.  For both sectors, the low risk ranking criteria was no history of overages. Low-moderate risk critera was small but infrequent overages. Moderate-high risk critera was routine, but small-moderate overages, and high risk criteria was routine, significant overages. 

Both surfclam and ocean quahog were low risk because they are well within recent quotas and are managed as ITQ fisheries with cage tags, etc.; any landings overages would be the result of enforcement issues. Recreational fisheries for scup, Atlantic mackerel, blueline tilefish, and spiny dogfish and commercial fisheries for scup, mackerel, butterfish, longfin squid, shortfin squid, golden and blueline tilefish, bluefish, and spiny dogfish were also low risk with no overages for the past 5 years and generally sufficient measures in place to avoid overages. However, it was noted that recreational scup fisheries could have improved inseason monitoring. Golden tilefish recreational was unranked because there are no catch and landings limits associated with the recreational fishery; recreational catches appear to be a minor component of total removals and are not included in the stock assessment. Bluefish recreational and commercial summer flounder and black sea bass fisheries were low-moderate risk with catches always within <2% of quota and limits exceeded by <5% twice in the past 5 years. Recreational summer flounder ranked moderate-high risk with highly variable performance relative to catch limits with two minor overages of the RHL between 2012-2016 and moderate underages in other years. Recreational black sea bass was ranked high risk because catch limits were exceeded substantially in all of the past 5 years. 

###Technical Interactions
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the risk of not achieving OY due to interactions with non-MAFMC managed species, including protected species. Here the risk is caused by negative consequences from fishing activity regulated under MAFMC FMPs which interacts with species managed by other agencies, including bycatch of protected species. For example, windowpane flounder accountability measures (AMs) implemented by the New England Council have the potential to negatively impact a number MAFMC managed fisheries if they are triggered. Similarly, interactions with marine mammals protected under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) could result in greater restrictions in MAFMC managed fisheries increasing the risk that OY would not be achieved in those fisheries. For example, the measures necessary for recovery of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale population have the potential to seriously impact numerous fisheries in the NE US.  
<!--
```{r riskmint, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No interactions with non-MAFMC managed species |
| Low-Moderate | Interactions with non-MAFMC managed species but infrequent, Category II fishery under MMPA; or AMs not likely triggered |
| Moderate-High | AMs in non-MAFMC managed species may be triggered; or Category I fishery under MMPA (but takes less than PBR) |
| High | AMs in non-MAFMC managed species triggered; or Category I fishery under MMPA and takes above PBR   |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```
-->

Evaluation of this risk element requires quantification of the likelihood that AMs under other non-MAFMC FMPs would be triggered (thus impacting fishing activities for MAFMC managed species). In addition, NMFS manages marine mammal interactions with commercial fishing activity through take reductions plans. In cases where an MAMFC fishery interacts with marine mammals, conservation measures implemented through a take reduction plan could negatively impact that fishery. Low risk ranking criteria were no interactions with non-MAFMC managed species or marine mammals. Low-Moderate risk criteria were interactions with non-MAFMC managed species but infrequent, therefore a Category II fishery under MMPA or AMs not likely triggered. Moderate-High risk criteria were that AMs in non-MAFMC managed species may be triggered, or a Category I fishery under MMPA (but takes less than potential biological removal(PBR) threshold). High risk criteria were AMs in non-MAFMC managed species triggered, or a Category I fishery under MMPA and takes above PBR. 

Surfclams and ocean quahogs were low risk with no documented interactions with proteced resources or other managed fisheries. Similarly, all recreational sector fisheries and commercial fisheries for bluefish, golden and blueline tilefish were ranked low risk as there are no known interactions with protected resources or accountability measures in other fisheries. Black sea bass, Atlantic mackerel, butterfish, and shortfin squid commercial fisheries were low-moderate risk as Category II fisheries and/or having infrequent interactions with marine mammals or protected river herring and shad. Moderate-high risk rankings included summer flounder and scup (Category II fisheries with potential to trigger AMs for windowpane flounder, a New England managed species), longfin squid (marine mammal interactions and turtle takes) and spiny dogfish (marine mammal interactions and sturgeon takes) commercial fisheries.

###Other Ocean Uses
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the risk of fishery displacement or damage of a fishery resource and/or habitat that supports it as a result of non-fishing activities in the ocean.  It also includes evaluation of risk to MAFMC fisheries from area based measures outside of the control of the Council including area closures implemented by other Councils to protect sensitive habitats, spawning areas, etc. and/or through marine monument or other types of area based management designations.       
<!--
```{r riskoou, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No overlap; no impact on habitat |
| Low-Moderate | Low-moderate overlap; minor habitat impacts but transient |

-->

Non-fishing ocean activities (e.g., energy development/sand mining/other industrial, etc.) and/or designation of areas where fishing is prohibited (i.e., marine monument designations or establishment of habitat protected areas by other Councils) could potentially impact MAFMC fisheries because they overlap with historical fishing grounds (physical displacement) and/or through negative impacts on important habitats.  This element can be evaluated through GIS analyses which quantify the degree of overlap and/or expert opinion relative impacts on habitat quality and function. In this case, Council staff used expert opinion. Low risk ranking critiera were no overlap with other ocean activities and/or no impact on habitat. Low-Moderate risk criteria were low-moderate overlap and/or minor habitat impacts but transient. Moderate-High risk critiera were moderate-high overlap and/or minor habitat impacts but persistent. High risk critiera were high overlap where other ocean uses could seriously disrupt fishery prosecution and/or major permanent habitat impacts. 

Recreational fisheries for Atlantic mackerel, golden and blueline tilefish, bluefish, and spiny dogfish and commercial fisheries for both tilefish, and other ocean uses. Commercial fisheries for surfclams, ocean quahogs, shortfin squid, and bluefish, and both sectors for summer flounder and scup ranked low-moderate risk due to the potential for minor habitat or fishery impacts from other ocean uses; these will depend on extent of development of those activities (i.e., energy, aquaculture, etc.). Recreational black sea bass (fixed gear) and commercial Atlantic mackerel, butterfish, and spiny dogfish ranked moderate-high risk due to potential for loss of access to fishing grounds (especially by mobile gear) and habitat loss due to offshore energy development in some prime fishing areas. However, it was noted for black sea bass that hard subsurface structures associated with energy production might provide some mitigation of habitat loss. Commercial black sea bass (mobile gear) and longfin squid ranked high risk due to potential for loss of access to fishing grounds and habitat loss due to offshore energy development in many prime fishing areas. Deepsea corals are also under management as protected habitat by the Council, and were ranked moderate-high risk for other ocean uses due to their sensitivity to benthic disturbance by a variety of activities. 

###Regulatory Complexity and Stability
This element is applied at the species and sector level. Constituents have frequently raised concerns about the complexity of fishery regulations and the need to simplify them to improve their efficacy. Complex regulations may lead to non-compliance and/or impact other fisheries.   
<!--
```{r riskcomplex, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | Simple/few regulations; rarely if ever change |

```
-->

This element could be evaluated by quantifying the number of regulations and/or the frequency of regulatory changes (based on evaluation of the Code of federal regulations). In terms of recreational fisheries, the magnitude and frequency of change of management measures (size and bag limits, seasons, etc.) could also be evaluated/quantified. For this assessment, Council staff working with each species used expert opinion to assess risk. Low risk ranking critiera were simple/few regulations that rarely if ever change. Low-Moderate risk criteria were low-moderate complexity regulations and/or occasional changes. Moderate-High risk critiera were moderate-high complexity and occasional changes. High risk criteira were high complexity regulations and/or frequently changed. 

Surfclam, ocean quahog, and golden tilefish fisheries ranked low risk with only minor changes to regulations in recent years, and catch specifications stable over many years. Similarly, bluefish recreational regulations are unchanged for the last decade, and recreational Atlantic mackerel and spiny dogfish fisheries have few regultations, so all ranked low risk for complexity. Commercial bluefish and shortfin squid ranked low-moderate risk with fairly complex regulations that have been stable over time, but may change in the near future. Both sectors for scup and and commercial summer flounder and black sea bass fisheries ranked moderate-high risk with mimimum size, commercial gear requirements, quota allocation system, reporting all very stable, but regulations can be complex, particularly at the state level with varying trip limits, permitting, and reporting systems. Moderate-high risk for blueline tilefish recreational and commercial and spiny dogfish commercial fisheries was based on recent and frequent changes in regulations. Recreational fisheries for summer flounder and black sea bass ranked high risk due to nearly annual changes in size, season and possession limits, significant differences between states, reporting and data estimation changes. Similarly, commerical fisheries for Atlantic mackerel, butterfish, and longfin squid regulations are highly complex and frequently changed, resulting in a high risk ranking. 

###Discards
This element is applied at the species and sector level. Stakeholders have identified the reduction of discards as a high priority in the Council management program, especially those caused by regulations since they represent biological and economic waste.  Discards of either the target or non-target species in the fishery would be taken into consideration. 
<!--
```{r riskdisc, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}

"

```
-->

NMFS provides estimates of discards by species based on at-sea observations collected in the Northeast Fisheries Observer Program for stock assessment purposes and quota monitoring. In addition, the MRIP provides estimate of discards by species for the recreational fisheries. Discards were evaluated for each species and fishery with focus on identification of discards caused by regulations for each fishery sector (commercial and recreational). Low risk ranking criteria was no significant discards. Low-Moderate risk ranking was low or episodic discard. Moderate-High risk ranking was regular discard but managed at an acceptable level. High risk critiera were high discard and difficult to manage. 

Surfclams and ocean quahogs ranked low risk because discards are a small percentage of total catch; these fisheries are allocated minimal observer coverage as a result. Low risk was also found for recreational spiny dogfish (low mortality if discarded), recreational Atlantic mackerel, all tilefish, and shortfin squid (no known discard problem) fisheries. Commercial fisheries for summer flounder, black sea bass, Atlantic mackerel, bluefish, and spiny dogfish ranked low-moderate risk due to relatively low (<20% of total catch) but consistent levels of overall discard. Moderate-high risk fisheries included scup (both sectors), butterfish, recreational black sea bass, and recreational bluefish due to relatively high, regular discard which is managed in the fisheries where it occurrs. Recreational summer flounder fisheries were ranked high risk due to live discards making up over 85% of rec catch, estimates are based on angler recall and uncertain and variable; many angler behavior and regulatory factors can influence discards that are poorly understood. Longfin squid fisheries ranked high risk due to high discards of both squid and other species. 

###Allocation
This element is applied at the species and sector level. This element addresses the risk of not achieving OY due to spatial mismatch of stocks and management allocations or because of sub-optimal allocation by sector and/or area.  Indicators for difficulty of allocation include a combination of distribution shifts (see above) and the number of interests (sectors, states, etc.) requiring allocation. 
<!--

-->

Each species and sector were evaluated relative to risk based on whether or not there is ongoing or recent (last three years) discussion by the Council concerning allocation. The EOP was unable to specify intermediate levels of risk for this element, so only low and high risk criteria were developed. Low risk ranking critiera were no recent or ongoing Council discussion about allocation. High risk ranking criteria were recent or ongoing Council discussion about allocation. 

Surfclam and ocean quahog rank low risk, with a single allocation applied to entire EEZ, plus small allocation for ME surfclam fishery. There is no recent Council discussion of allocation, and these fisheries have flexibility to catch and land virtually anywhere. Similarly scup (both sectors), butterfish, shortfin squid, golden tilefish (both sectors), and recreational spiny dogfish are not subject to recent allocation discussions, and ranked low risk. All other fisheries (summer flounder, black sea bass, Atlantic mackerel, blueline tilefish, bluefish, and commercial spiny dogfish) have recent and often contentions ongoing allocation discussions. 

#Discussion
We have presented the process and results of the initial EAFM risk assessment for the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. This is a useful example for the general implementation of ecosystem approaches to natural resource management in at least three ways, outlined here and detailed below. First, it demonstrates that risk assessment is a quick, familiar, scaleable, and transparent method to move forward with EAFM within a real-world operational fishery management context. Second, we found several areas where improvement to the process will be possible in both future iterations of this assessment and in other applications. Third, this risk assessment can be used in several ways to identify prorities and next steps for the Council within its EAFM policy guidance framework. While governance and management frameworks differ, the flexibility and practicality of this type of risk assessment make it a valuable tool in other contexts as well. 

Ecological risk assessment has been applied in worldwide in fisheries and natural resource situations [@us_epa_guidelines_1998; @fletcher_application_2005; ]. Further, it is a component of integrated ecosystem assessment [@levin_integrated_2009, @depiper_operationalizing_2017], with examples [@samhouri_linking_2012] as well as frameworks for applying risk assessment within the ecosystem assessment process [@holsman_ecosystem-based_2017]. Why then are there relatively few examples of EAFM risk assessment applications in U.S. fishery management? We offer the following advantages of this risk assessment to encourage further uptake. This risk assessment was quick: it was implemented in under 6 months with existing data to meet management timeframes.  Risk assessment is scaleable and can be tailored to the problem at hand: here, the Council determined the appropriate dimensions of the assessment. However, risk assessment can be expert-based at an aggregate level and take even less time [e.g. @gaichas_risk-based_2014], or at the species level and addressing detailed components of one risk element, taking more time [e.g. @chin_integrated_2010; @hare_vulnerability_2016], or hierarchichal, with quick simple coverage of many low risks and more detailed, time consuming analysis devoted to high risks [e.g., @hobday_ecological_2011]. Risk assessment is familiar: many Council members and stakeholders unfamiliar with aspects of EAFM are familiar with the concepts of risk assessment due to its widely applicable standards and common use across many industries and businesses [@iso_risk_2009; @iso_risk_2009-1; @iso_risk_2009-2]. This makes risk assessment an accessible entry point for management organizations. Risk assessment is transparent and collaborative: here, the Council discussed, defined, and selected risk elements at public meetings. All other decisions were reached in public meetings, including discussion of indicators, proposed and amended risk ranking criteria, and results, and for this assessment there was no need for knowledge of complex quantitative methods to understand. The collaborative, iterative nature of this risk assessment may transfer well to other contexts and allow fuller use of ecological risk assessment in decision making.

Because this was the initial EAFM risk assessment for the Council in what is intended to be a continuing process rather than a static product, we were able to identify areas to improve in future years as the process is repeated. For example, the short timeframe for completing this risk assessment required that we postpone work on statistical methods for indicator selection [*ADD REFS*]. However, many elements seleted by the Council had only one indicator time series available, such that selection methods were not required. Nevertheless, further testing of the indicators for consistency and reliability [*ADD REFS*] should be a high priority for use in future assessments. In addition, statistical analysis of time series requires further examination. We used pre-whitening to address potential autocorrelation in indicator time series that could result in unreliable statistical significance tests [@yue_influence_2002]. However, further simulation work is required to determine the reliability of significance tests for indicator time series with different degress of autocorrelation and trends. Given the flexible nature of risk assessment, any necessary updates and corrections can be incorporated in future iterations of the risk assessment. Finally, we reiterate that for many of these elements (aside from biomass and fishing mortality status), there is no established high risk threshold, so the consensus of the Council and committee were used to establish risk levels. If clear thresholds become available for any element/indicator combination, they can be substituted into future assessments. 

Risk assessment will be used to lead into other aspects of IEA loop. An indicator-based assessment does not provide a mechanistic assessment of the system, which is only possible through a structural modeling approach, which could be focused specifically on fully assessing and mitigating identified risks. The Council will use the risk assessment to prioritize these more detailed analyses. According to the accepted framework within the EAFM policy guidance, risk assessment results will be used to prioritize and refine the key management questions and issues for further evaluation [@gaichas_framework_2016]. The next step will be the development of three example conceptual models which aim to showcase different approaches the  MAFMC could use to move from this initial risk assessment to specifying a more in-depth analysis of a particular high prority question. One potential approach focuses on the species with the largest number of high risk rankings across all elements, which is black sea bass (8 high risk elements, Tables \ref{sptable}-\ref{ecotable}). A second approach focuses on the species complex with the highest landings value and seafood production (as a proxy for benefits), which is longfin squid, a species with uncertainties in assessment and potential for distribution shifts along with high risks identified across multiple management elements (Tables \ref{sptable}-\ref{spsectable}). A third approach focuses on the risk element with the most high risk categorizations across species, which is allocation (12 high risk species/sector combinations; Table \ref{spsectable}). A conceptual model based on the first approach has been developed to illustrate the process (Fig. \ref{bsbex}).  Consideration of these candidate approaches as well as others to be developed by the Council are underway with the EOP as of summer 2018.

In the MAFMC EAFM framework, specifying a conceptual model in turn provides the initial scoping for more in-depth management strategy evaluation (MSE), where simulation modeling is used to test alternative methods for achieving specific managment objectives under uncertainty [@sainsbury_design_2000; @butterworth_why_2007; @punt_developing_2007; @punt_management_2016]. MSE is generally recognized as a core component of the ecosystem approach [@smith_scientific_2007, @levin_integrated_2009, @levin_guidance_2014], but can be a resource-intensive process when applied even to relatively simple single species harvest control rules [e.g., @jones_stakeholder-centered_2016]. Ecosystem approaches to fisheries management potentially expand the scope of interactions and uncertainties to consider in evaluating harvest control rules and other fishery management procedures. How can managers ensure that the most important MSE gets done first? Risk assessment provides a systematic framework to ensure that limited MSE resources address the highest priority ecosystem interactions and risks. A risk matrix, such as the one developed in this study, can be used to quickly evaluate where further integrated analysis and MSE should be focused--which fishery management plans, which species, and which risk elements need to be included in the analysis. Further, because the risk assessment includes social and economic elements as well as the more standard ecological elements, the conceptual model and resulting MSE are designed to include the relevant linkages and therefore avoid unintended consequences of management actions [@degnbol_unintended_2007]. 

Similar to many other regions worldwide, natural resource management challenges are mounting in the Mid-Atlantic, from climate change to increasing needs for food and recreational opportunties to increasing uses of ocean areas (wind farm proposals). This process was completed alongside the current management system, and adds value now and for future planning. This EAFM risk assessment highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting MAFMC management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors. The tabular color coded summaries of risk assessment results will be used by MAFMC to prioritize further EAFM analyses as well as research plans over the coming five years. As ecosystem reporting and operational EAFM continue to evolve in future years, MAFMC forsees integrating these efforts so that ecosystem indicators are refined to meet the needs of fishery managers in identifying and managing risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives. Overall, ecosystem indicator-based risk assessment is a method that can be adapted to a wide range of resource management systems and available information, and therefore a promising way forward in the implementation of EAFM.

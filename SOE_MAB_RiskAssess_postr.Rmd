**Abstract** Ecosystem approaches to fisheries management (EAFM) potentially expand the scope of interactions and uncertainties to consider in evaluating harvest control rules and other fishery management procedures. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is generally recognized as a core component of EAFM, but can be a resource-intensive process when applied even to relatively simple single species harvest control rules. How can managers ensure that the most important MSE gets done first? Risk assessment provides a systematic framework to ensure that limited MSE resources address the highest priority ecosystem interactions and risks.

### **Risk Elements**

The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council recently adopted EAFM policy guidance that outlines a framework involving risk assessment as the first step towards addressing species, climate, habitat and fishery interactions [@gaichas_framework_2016]. Over the past year, the Council has defined a range of ecological, economic, social, and management related elements that track risk to achieving Council management goals and objectives.

### **Risk Definitions and Indicators**

The risk was then evaluated as low, moderate, or high according to defined ranking criteria and measured by one or more ecosystem indicators assessed at multiple levels; ranging from single-species to system-wide. 

#### F status and B status

These elements are applied at the species level. Fishing mortality (F) rates and biomass (B) levels relative to established reference points from assessments indicate the level of risk to achieving OY. <!--Risk level definitions for F and B are below.-->

```{r riskF, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | F < Fmsy |
| Low-Moderate | Unknown, but weight of evidence indicates low overfishing risk |
| Moderate-High | Unknown status |
| High | F > Fmsy |
"

```{r riskB, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | B > Bmsy |
| Low-Moderate | Bmsy > B > 0.5 Bmsy, or unknown, but weight of evidence indicates low risk |
| Moderate-High | Unknown status |
| High | B < 0.5 Bmsy |

### **Results: Summary Tables**

The resulting risk matrix can be used to quickly evaluate where further integrated analysis and MSE should be focused--which fishery management plans, which species, and which risk elements need to be included in the analysis. The ecosystem indicators are updated and reviewed regularly, so that the Council can update the EAFM risk assessment as needed.

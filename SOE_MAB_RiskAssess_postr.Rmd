**Abstract** Ecosystem approaches to fisheries management (EAFM) potentially expand the scope of interactions and uncertainties to consider in evaluating harvest control rules and other fishery management procedures. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is generally recognized as a core component of EAFM, but can be a resource-intensive process when applied even to relatively simple single species harvest control rules. How can managers ensure that the most important MSE gets done first? Risk assessment provides a systematic framework to ensure that limited MSE resources address the highest priority ecosystem interactions and risks.

### **EAFM Framework and Risk Elements**

The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council adopted EAFM policy guidance that outlines a framework where risk assessment is the first step in addressing species, climate, habitat and fishery interactions [@gaichas_framework_2016]. 

<img src="Framework.png" style="width:100%"></img>
<hr>

The Council has defined a range of risk elements.

### **Risk Definitions and Indicators: Examples**

The risk was then evaluated as <span style="background:lime">low</span>, <span style="background:yellow">low-moderate</span>, <span style="background:orange">moderate-high</span>, or <span style="background:red">high</span> according to defined ranking criteria and measured by one or more ecosystem indicators assessed at multiple levels; ranging from single-species to system-wide. 

####Climate {.small}
This element is applied at the species level. Risks to species productivity (and therefore to achieving OY) due to projected climate change in the Northeast US were evaluated in a comprehensive assessment [@hare_vulnerability_2016]. <!--This assessment evaluated exposure of each species to multiple climate threats, including ocean and air temperature, ocean acidification, ocean salinity, ocean currents, precipitation, and sea level rise. The assessment also evaluated the sensitivity (*not extinction risk*) of each species based on habitat and prey specificity, sensitivity to temperature and ocean acidification, multiple life history factors, and number of non-climate stressors. <!--This assessment is intended to be conducted iteratively, so these results can be updated in the future. -->

```{r riskclim, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | Low climate vulnerability ranking |
| Low-Moderate | Moderate climate vulnerability ranking |
| Moderate-High | High climate vulnerability ranking |
| High | Very high climate vulnerability ranking |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--Mid-Atlantic species were all either highly or very highly exposed to climate risk in this region, and ranged from low to very high sensitivity to expected climate change in the Northeast US. The combination of exposure and sensitivity results in the overall vulnerability ranking. We applied those climate vulnerability rankings directly here (Fig. \ref{NEVAvul}). -->

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, 'NEVAvulmid.png'))

```

####Commercial Revenue {.small}
This element is applied at the ecosystem level<!--, and addresses the risk of not maximizing fishery value-->. Revenue serves as a proxy for commercial profits<!--, which is the component of a fishery's value that this element is ultimately attempting to assess risk towards-->. 

```{r riskcomval, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trend and low variability in revenue |
| Low-Moderate | Increasing or high variability in revenue |
| Moderate-High | Significant long term revenue decrease |
| High | Significant recent decrease in revenue |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

<!--This is aggregate commercial revenue for MAFMC managed species. There is a long term significant decrease in revenue, indicating moderate-high risk to commercial fishery profit. This trend is consistent with the trend first shown in the EAFM Interactions white paper and published in @gaichas_framework_2016 (Figs 2-3).-->

```{r ComProfAgg, fig.height=2.5, out.width="100%"}
#, fig.cap="Aggregate Mid-Atlantic managed species revenue  \\label{comprofagg}", echo = F, fig.height=2.5, out.width='0.9\\linewidth', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(4, 6, 2, 2))

aggrev <- SOE.data[Var %like% "MAFMC Revenue"]
setkey(aggrev, Time)
allrev <- aggrev[, sum(Value, na.rm = T), by = key(aggrev)]
setnames(allrev, 'V1', 'Value')
allrev[, Var := paste('MAFMC Revenue')]
allrev[, Units := 'USD']
allrev[, EPU := 'ALL']

soe.plot(allrev, 'Time', 'MAFMC Revenue', x.label="Year", y.label="Commercial Revenue \n 2015 Adjusted USD", x.start = 1986, rel.y.num = 0.8, rel.y.text = 0.8)
```

####Fishing Mortality Control {.small}
This element is applied at the species and sector level. <!--This element addresses the level of management control in terms of catch estimation (measurement) and monitoring to prevent overfishing. <!--Adequate management control indicates a low risk of overfishing, while poor management control indicates a higher risk of overfishing and hence not achieving OY.-->  Actual catch is compared with the specified ABC over the most recent five years.

```{r riskctl, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No history of overages |
| Low-Moderate | Small overages, but infrequent |
| Moderate-High | Routine overages, but small to moderate |
| High | Routine significant overages |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```


### **Results: Summary Tables**

The resulting risk matrix can be used to quickly evaluate where further integrated analysis and MSE should be focused--which fishery management plans, which species, and which risk elements need to be included in the analysis. The Council can revisit the EAFM risk assessment as needed using updated ecosystem indicators.

####Discussion
MSE is a promising but resource-intensive approach for EAFM. Involving stakeholders to establish a range of objectives and performance measures for MSE is critically important for developing management procedures that balance social, economic, and ecological needs, but requires even more resources. Risk assessment is a flexible and transparent method incorporating a wide range of concerns and available data; an important strategic tool for further Council progress on EAFM.
